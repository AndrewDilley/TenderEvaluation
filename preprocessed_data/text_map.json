[["Purpose\nWannon Water is committed to continuously improving Zero Harm outcomes including Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) and Wellbeing. This extends to minimising all hazards and risks associated with the adverse effects of alcohol and drug use. The purpose of this procedure is to provide employees, contractors and visitors with the responsibilities, tolerances and direction regarding the purchase, storage and consumption of alcohol and drugs in the workplace.\nScope\nThis procedure applies to all employees, contractors, contractor\u2019s employees, and visitors of Wannon Water, while on Wannon Water sites or performing work on or behalf of the Corporation.   The collective term used in this procedure for these defined groups will be individuals unless otherwise stated. \nProcedure \nResponsibilities\nThe OHS Act requires employees to take reasonable care for their own health and safety in the workplace, and the health and safety of others who may be affected by their acts or omissions. This includes ensuring they are not, as a result of alcohol or other drugs, affected in a way that may put themselves, others, or the organisation at risk.\n\nWannon Water considers any blood alcohol concentration can cause impairment and may affect an individual\u2019s ability to work, behave and make decisions safely.\n \nAll individuals on a Wannon Water site or performing work for Wannon Water during the hours of 6am - 6pm Monday to Friday inclusive, or on call or standby (rostered), or for those activities that require a legal 0.0 blood alcohol concentration, must not have in their system any alcohol, or illegal drugs, prescription, or over the counter medication not approved by Wannon Water (as per 3.1.4 and 3.5.2).\n\nIn the case of any prescription medications or over the counter drugs, all individuals who may be taking these are required to inform Wannon Water via their manager of any potential effects that has the potential to reduce their capacity to undertake the inherent requirements of their role, behave, or make decisions safely.\n\nNOTE: Some medications, whether over the counter or prescribed, contain warnings about driving and or operating machinery.  Wannon Water requires employees who are taking any medication that may compromise performance and/or safety to advise their manager of the existence of such warnings prior to starting work.\u201d  Note that it is not necessary for the employee to disclose the illness for which they are taking medication.  The employee may be required to provide some means of verification (such as a medical certificate) as to the side effects of the medication if the medication is to be taken over an extended period of time.  The medical practitioner may need to be provided with a list of the employee\u2019s tasks so an informed assessment can be made.\n\nThe manager will take into account any effects of the medication when assigning the employee\u2019s tasks in consultation with People & Wellbeing.\n\nAll individuals are required to immediately report any person on Wannon Water site or performing work on or behalf of Wannon Water who they consider may be impaired by alcohol or drug use and are deemed at risk of jeopardizing the safety of themselves or others.\n\nAll employees and managers are empowered to stop any individual from working or entering a Wannon Water site if they have reasonable cause to believe the worker is impaired.\n \nAny alcohol or drug related incidents must be formally lodged on the IMS system.\n\nContractors / Visitors\n\nContractors and their employees working on Wannon Water sites have the same obligations as an employee of Wannon Water.\n\nWhere a contractor\u2019s employee is reasonably suspected of being impaired whether due to alcohol or drugs, the Wannon Water employee responsible for the contractor (Contractor Manager) will require the contractor to remove the offending person from the site. The contractor shall bear any costs associated with the removal and any cessation of work that results from the removal. The Contract Manager (or Superintendent if there is one) shall consider the safety of that person and their ability to arrange suitable transport to a safe location and may consider suspending the works until the situation is made safe.\n\nWhen a visitor to a Wannon Water site is deemed to be affected by alcohol or other drugs, they are to be directed to leave the site.  Wannon Water shall consider the safety of the visitor and their ability to arrange suitable transport to a safe location.  The relevant manager shall be informed of the incident and any further action that may be required.\n\nReasonable Suspicion of Impairment\nEmployees\nWhere an employee is identified as possibly being affected by alcohol or other drugs, it must be reported to a manager immediately.  The individual must be directed to stop whatever they are doing or denied entry to site. The manager should contact the Executive People & Resilience or Senior Manager People & Wellbeing immediately for further instruction. \n\nThe employee will be provided the opportunity to demonstrate that they are not impaired by alcohol or drugs. If Wannon Water considers that the employee\u2019s ability to work in a safe manner is compromised, then arrangements will be made for the employee to immediately stop work, undertake impairment testing and be taken home safely at Wannon Water\u2019s expense. (arrangements may also need to be made for the storage/return of the employee\u2019s vehicle).\n\nImpairment Testing\nImpairment testing, also referred to as fitness for work or fitness for duty testing systems, measures actual impairment (rather than the presence of alcohol and/ or drugs or drug by-products in the system). Tests vary and can include testing reaction times on a computer and eye reaction to light. Impairment testing may be in conjunction with, alcohol and other drug testing at the workplace. Where a drug or alcohol test is requiring that the employee is escorted to the Emergency Department of the nearest Public Health facility for the purpose of a blood test or other recommended testing to be undertaken.\nWhere an employee is found to be in breach of this procedure, it will be considered a serious violation and employee misconduct. Appropriate action will be taken as per the Consequences of Employee Misconduct Procedure. The Executive People & Resilience together with senior management will make this judgment. Wannon Water has a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d approach to employees affected by alcohol or drugs in the workplace, and any incident may result in termination\nIf an employee refuses to participate in the alcohol and/or drug test, this will be assumed as the employee being impaired and action will commence accordingly consistent with Wannon Water\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d approach. \n\nLoss of Drivers Licence\nWhere an employee licence is suspended the employee must notify Wannon Water. In the event of an employee losing their licence, continuation of employment will be assessed based on whether the loss of licence prevents the worker from carrying out the inherent requirements of the job. The appropriate General Manager in conjunction with the Executive People & Resilience will undertake the assessment.\n\nConsumption, Distribution and Storage of Drugs and Alcohol on Wannon Water Premises\nNo individual shall unlawfully possess, use, sell or distribute illicit drugs whilst engaged in Wannon Water business or on Wannon Water premises. Failure to comply with this clause will result in action taken under the Consequences of Employee Misconduct Procedure for employees and the incident will be reported to Police.\nThe consumption of alcohol on property owned, leased or occupied by Wannon Water is prohibited, unless authorised by the Managing Director. Any authorised functions shall be monitored with the view of the responsible consumption of alcohol e.g. limited provision of alcohol and the provision of non-alcoholic drinks.\nThe purchase of alcohol by Wannon Water must be authorised by the Managing Director. Other than transient storage (Clause 8.4 below) the storage of alcohol on Wannon Water premises will only be permissible for the purpose of Managing Director approved functions and alcohol storage shall be separate to the storage of milk and other daily food or beverage consumables.\nShort term (less than 2 days) transient storage of low quantities of alcohol by employees is permitted for the purposes supporting employees undertake shopping activities during the work day and/or transfers to and from home.\n\n\nInformation, Education and Training\nAll employees will be provided with a copy of this procedure (new employees at the time of their Induction). \n\nAll employees will be provided access to information on alcohol and drugs and their effects - including details of such things as community services and programs offering assistance.\n\nManagers may be required to participate in training programs provided to further understand how to identify employees affected by alcohol or other drugs, how to manage associated risk, and their specific responsibilities under the alcohol and other drugs policy.\n\nRehabilitation and Employee Assistance Program (EAP)\nWannon Water acknowledges that some employees will experience problems as a result of their own or others alcohol or drug use.  While this use will not be accepted as an excuse for poor performance or inappropriate behaviour, alcohol and drug related problems will be addressed in a supportive and constructive way for those willing to deal with their problems and working to overcome them.  \n\nEmployees who identify as having an alcohol and/or other drugs problem referred to professional assistance, which might include Wannon Water\u2019s EAP. Employees can also choose to access the service of their own accord. EAPs provide a confidential service to assist employees to resolve personal issues which may affect their work performance and can add to the effectiveness of a workplace alcohol and other drugs policy. Further information on Wannon Water\u2019s Employee Assistance Program can be located on Watershed.\nDefinitions \nGovernance\n\nDocument version history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Alcohol and Drugs in the Workplace Procedure.DOCX"], ["PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure employees are aware of behaviour that could amount to misconduct and that all relevant parties are aware of Wannon Water's policy for dealing with misconduct. \n\nPOLICY\nWannon Water expects employees to observe acceptable standards of behaviour.\nEmployees must not engage in behaviour that amounts to misconduct (including serious misconduct) at the workplace. This includes where employees are working on site or off-site, attending a work-related conference or function, or attending a client or other work-related event, including retreats and social events.\n\nFailure to follow these rules may result in disciplinary action ranging from counselling, training, a written warning or termination, depending on the severity of the offence.\n\nSCOPE\nThis disciplinary procedure applies to all employees.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS \nNIL.\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\nManagers\nManagers are responsible for:\nidentifying and addressing situations of employee misconduct and trying to informally resolve them in the first instance, where appropriate. in consultation with People & Wellbeing\nallegations or instances of misconduct are reported to People & Wellbeing in a timely manner\nProvide support and information to any investigation process.\n\nPeople and Wellbeing\nAre responsible for:\nEnsuring employees are provided procedural fairness in investigation processes\nConfidentiality is maintained to the extent possible\nThe processes in this procedure are followed\n\nEmployees\nAre responsible to:\ncomply with this policy and related procedures; and\nreport any instances or allegations of misconduct to the relevant manager, or People & Wellbeing  as appropriate\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\nExamples of breaches of conduct and behaviour\nThe following is a list of conduct and behaviours, incidents or events that may result in disciplinary action, but it should not be considered all-inclusive.  Management has the discretion to review this list or its interpretation.\n\nRemoving or misplacing company property or equipment, customer information, or Wannon Water documentation without prior approval.  This includes transferring, forwarding, removing or copying intellectual property.\n\nViolation of Wannon Water policies or procedures.\n\nActions or behaviours as an employee or private citizen that result in criminal charges.\n\nAny action that puts in jeopardy the health and/or safety of any employee or member of the public.\n\nAny actions or behaviours that constitute bullying or harassment.\n\nWilful destruction or damaging of any Wannon Water property.\n\nFailure to follow directions, work requests, rules and responsibilities as required by management or the Employee\u2019s immediate supervisor.\n\nAny breach of confidentiality relating to employees or Wannon Water business.\n\nUnauthorised comment in the media.\n\nConsistent absence from work without proper cause and documentation.\n\nConsumption of unauthorised alcohol or illicit drugs whilst undertaking Wannon Water duties or in a Wannon Water workplace.\n\nViolation of any local, state or federal laws.\n\nImproper use of Internet or email services.\n\n\nPROCEDURE\nWhere disciplinary action becomes necessary, the following options will form part of the process.\n\nDiscussion & Verbal Warning \nThis is a verbal conversation where the Employee and relevant Manager will discuss the event/incident.  This will result in recommendations for improvements, together with an action or training plan with timelines where appropriate.\n\nDepending on the seriousness of the incident or conduct requiring disciplinary action and in consultation with People & Wellbeing a First Written Warning may also be issued along with this initial Discussion/Verbal Warning.\n\nFirst Written Warning\nIf there is no significant improvement as agreed above, or another incident takes place, or the seriousness of the incident or conduct requiring disciplinary action is such that this is the initial step, the Senior Manager People & Wellbeing in consultation with the employee\u2019s manager, will issue a written warning.  The Managing Director or a General Manager is required to countersign this written warning.\n\nThe Employee has the right to discuss this written warning and comment in writing.  If the Employee wishes to discuss the matter, they may elect the conversation to take place in the presence of a representative chosen by the Employee.  The Senior Manager People & Wellbeing and the employees Manager will be in attendance.\n\nDocuments related to the matter will be placed on the Employee\u2019s personnel file.\n\nFurther or Final Written Warning\nA further or final written warning can be issued if there has been no marked improvement as agreed above, or another incident occurs.  The Senior Manager People & Wellbeing and the employees Manager will complete the written warning, detailing the reasons for a further or final warning.  The Managing Director or a General Manager is required to countersign this warning.  \n\nA copy will be placed on the Employee\u2019s personnel file.  This stage may also incur loss of any privileges obtained with the position if deemed appropriate.\n\nTermination\nIn the event of a serious breach of policy or procedure that has the potential to harm the employee, colleagues or members of the public or behaviours or conduct that constitutes criminal actions the employee will be terminated without notice.\nFurther to written warnings being issued, should any further misconduct occur, the employee may also be terminated without notice.  \nIt is the responsibility of the Senior Manager People & Resilience and the employees Manager to thoroughly investigate a serious incident to ensure that termination without notice is warranted.  Documentation of reason, and action taken, will be placed on the personnel file.\n\nImmediate Termination\nWhere the incident or conduct has been unacceptable and of a serious nature, immediate dismissal may take place.  Examples of this type of incident or conduct include (but are not limited to):\nWilful or deliberate unacceptable behaviour by an employee.\nImminent and serious risk to the health and safety of any person.\nSerious damage to or loss of assets.\nReduction in the reputation and/or viability of Wannon Water.\nAccessing, storing or dissemination of child pornography.\nFraud against Wannon Water, customer of Wannon Water or associated organisation.\nPhysical assault of an employee, customer, or other work-related person.\nBeing under the influence or adversely affected by drugs in the workplace.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Managing Director or a General Manager to conduct the termination.\n\nDocuments of reason and action taken will be placed on the Employee\u2019s personnel file.\n\nDOCUMENTATION\nNIL.\n\nREFERENCES\nWannon Water Code of Conduct\n\nWannon Water Harassment and Bullying Free Workplace\n\nDOCUMENT CONTROL\n", "Consequence Of Employee Misconduct.DOCX"], ["Purpose\nTo provide practical guidance for the management of Contractors to eliminate potential harm to human health, the environment, drinking water and our operations, as far as reasonably practicable, and to ensure compliance with regulatory obligations.\n\nContractors, a person or company engaged to work for us, are an integral part of our operations and make up a significant proportion of our workforce.

A cyber security incident is any event that threatens the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of the organisation\u2019s information and operational assets. The framework and processes set out in this document align to Wannon Water\u2019s Cyber Resilience Strategy, the business Emergency Management Plan (EMP), and the best practice standards for cyber security incident management (NIST 800-61 and ISO-27035).\nThis Framework document should be read in conjunction with the individual cyber incident management plan scenario playbooks (Playbooks) to ensure a robust and holistic approach is taken to managing cyber incidents. The individual Playbooks provide the Wannon Water Information Security Incident Response Team (ISIRT) with step by step instructions for each of the following incident types:\nData Breach\nThird Party Data Breach\nRansomware\nPhishing\nSystem Compromise\nDenial of Service (DOS)\n\nHaving an effective incident reporting and investigation framework enables Wannon Water to meet legislative obligations, ensure lessons are learned from incidents occurring, and help identify controls to prevent reoccurrence. Wannon Water is exposed to numerous incidents of varying type and severity levels ranging from incidents that can be managed on-site locally (e.g. an isolated security breach) to wide scale incidents involving service disruption across multiple systems.\n\n\nScope\nIn scope\nThe Wannon Water Cyber Security Incident Management Framework encompasses the identification and management of incidents:\nin the Information Technology (IT) domain;\nin the Operational Technology (OT) domain;\nthat are defined in the EMP and have as a contributing root cause a cyber security event. For example, the compromise of an OT SCADA system by software infection which ultimately impacts water flow or water quality would involve the instigation of cyber incident management processes (the Playbook linked to System Compromise) under this framework, as well as the instigation of incident management processes related to the non-cyber impacts of the compromise (as per the EMP). \n\nOut of scope\nThe following items are considered out of scope for the application of this framework:\nThe management and treatment of Incidents that are not related to cyber security factors and do not have cyber security issues as a contributing cause of any incident (i.e. no impact to systems, technology or data and no causes related to the materialisation of cyber security threats). \nBusiness continuity or business response beyond technical IT and OT controls.\n\nIncident Management Lifecycle\nCyber Security Incidents are managed in accordance with the guidelines set out in the NIST 800-61 Incident Response Lifecycle and accord to four main phases. These phases represent the application of best practice incident management processes:\nPreparation\nDetection & Analysis\nContainment, Eradication & Recovery\nPost-Incident Activity\nFigure 1 shows a visual representation of the 4 phases.\nThis document examines all 4 phases from a holistic standpoint, whilst the individual Playbooks (representing incident scenarios) focus on the fine details of phases 2 and 3. Where there is variation from what is described in this document for phases 1 and 4, this is detailed in the individual Playbooks. \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 NIST 800-61 Incident Response Lifecycle\n\n\nThe EMP sets out 3 levels of severity for the classification of incidents \u2013 in order of increasing severity: (i) Operational, (ii) Enhanced Operational, and (iii) Incident Management Team (IMT). Each level also has increasing levels of incident complexity, employee involvement, resourcing, internal liaison and external liaison.  \n\nImpacts from a cyber security incident are commonly graded on a severity scale with 5 levels: \n\nNone/negligible; \nMinor; \nModerate; \nHigh; \nVery High. \n\nRefer to Appendix A for a detailed description of the cyber security incident impact types against these severity levels. \n\nA formal declaration of a cyber security incident could ultimately lead to the declaration of an Emergency, as defined in the EMP (p14). In this instance, procedures for cyber security incident remediation and Emergency remediation may be applied conjunctionally to aid in incident recovery. \n\n\nResponse \nThis document sets out how to deal with cyber security incidents as per the 4 phases defined in the previous section:\nPreparation\nDetection & Analysis\nContainment, Eradication & Recovery\nPost-Incident Activity\nEach phase will be detailed in this section. The information hereafter should be considered in conjunction with the Playbook relevant to the incident scenario. \n\nPreparation\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Preparation phase of the Incident Response Lifecycle\n\nOverarching responsibility for implementing the incident response framework for Wannon Water falls to the Information Security Incident Response Team. The ISIRT is an organisational function that covers the process for information security incidents and is focused mainly on IT security incidents. At a bare minimum, the members of the ISIRT accord with the following organisational roles:\nInformation Security Manager\nIT Operations Manager\nChief Information Officer\nManager Risk & Resilience\nEnterprise Network Technical Lead\n\nAdditional members may be recruited into the ISIRT from time to time as needed to meet the requirements of incidents as they occur.\n\nIncident response methodologies typically emphasise preparation\u2014not only establishing an incident response capability so that the organization is ready to respond to incidents, but also preventing incidents by ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are sufficiently secure. Although the ISIRT is not wholly responsible for incident prevention, its role is fundamental to the success of incident response programs.\n\nAdditional measures to ensure adequate preparation for the occurrence of a cyber security incident are listed as follows:\n\nEnsure an updated and reviewed contact matrix is maintained, detailing key contacts both within and external to Wannon Water. Information to include email addresses, phone numbers, and if applicable public encryption keys. Refer also to the Core Services Map documents for critical system ownership and information;\nOn-call information and escalation criteria; \nEstablished incident management and risk reporting system, supported by issue tracking and problem management functionality (e.g. IRIS or equivalent risk management system);\nSecure storage systems for securing incident history, forensic evidence etc.;\n24 hour/365 days monitoring of key security variables (logging and event management) via a dedicated Security Operations Centre (SOC);\nCyber security education, training and awareness programs (supported by, for example, phishing awareness campaigns);\nVulnerability management programs to detect and mitigate system security vulnerabilities;\nIn-house or externally available digital forensic capability, including evidence gathering resources such as chain of custody forms, digital cameras, audio recorders, evidence storage bags etc.;\nConfiguration Management Database (CMDB) to include configuration items for all critical systems, Operating Systems (OSs), applications, network devices, and secure configuration baseline for critical systems;\nNetwork diagrams and listings of all critical digital assets (e.g. servers ,databases and OT devices);\nDocumentation for OSs, applications and network security appliances (e.g. firewalls and intrusion detection systems);\nReady access to clean images of Standard Operating Environment (SOE) OS and key applications, to aid in restoration and recovery. These artefacts should be a part of a data and system backup management plan. \nAdherence to a published schedule for testing the Cyber Security Incident Response Plan and Playbooks via simulation or tabletop exercises. These will be used to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the Framework and should feed into the Lessons Learned aspect of Phase 4. \nConfiguration documentation, where available, for OT devices.\n\n\n\nDetection and Analysis\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Detection & Analysis phase of the Incident Response Lifecycle\n\n\nCyber security incidents are highly variable in nature, so capturing common characteristics for all of them is not possible. An incident can evolve from a cyber security event that does not conform to expected behaviour or parameters. This type of event may or may not lead to the formal identification of an incident (See Appendix D). Once a particular incident has been identified (for example, Ransomware), the appropriate Playbook should be consulted and read in conjunction with this document. Following detection and analysis, incident triage and classification will need to be applied. \nDetection: The detection of a cyber security incident can come from many sources. The most common for Wannon Water would include:\nSecurity Operations Centre alerting/notification\nEnd user/employee\nWannon Water Customer\nHelpdesk\nVendor \nVulnerability assessment\nAudit\n\nAnalysis: At the point of notification, it is not certain that the alert will result in a formal incident being identified. It is the task of the ISIRT to determine if an incident is to be declared by applying a triage and classifying the incident. Triage will determine the incident severity, and the classification will determine what Playbook/s should be consulted for progressing incident remediation. Considerations for the ISIRT include:\nAssessment of risk\nDetermine scope of impact \u2013 IT and / or OT?\nIs company proprietary data involved?\nIs Personally Identifiable Information (PII) involved?\nInterview the notification source/s\nIdentification of affected systems and information assets, including the BIL ratings of impacted information.\nData collation\nCriticality of the systems involved\nWhere OT systems are involved, the businesses capacity to continue operations with those systems degraded or unavailable\nDuring the Triage and Classification process, the ISIRT should convene and initiate a conference call with all concerned stakeholders. Required and optional attendees are listed in Table 1. \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Conference Call Attendees\n\n* Optional attendees (dependent on incident type). \nHighlighted rows reflect conference call attendees if escalation is indicated as per Tables 2 and 3\nOnce all required members have been added into the conference call, the ISIRT should ensure that the meeting events are carefully recorded in meeting minutes or voice recorded. This information will be used to help complete an Incident Report or Incident Log if an incident is subsequently declared. An Incident Log template is included in Appendix E. \nAlthough the primary reason for gathering evidence during an incident is to resolve the incident, it may also be needed for legal proceedings. In such cases, it is important to clearly document how all evidence, including compromised systems, has been preserved. Evidence should be collected according to procedures that meet all applicable laws and regulations which have been developed from previous discussions with legal staff and appropriate law enforcement agencies. This is to ensure that any evidence is admissible in court. In addition, evidence should be accounted for at all times: whenever evidence is transferred from person to person, chain of custody forms should detail the transfer and include each party\u2019s signed authorisation. A detailed log should therefore be kept for all evidence. \n\nApplying a triage will help to determine the incident severity and classification. Given that the full impact and root cause of the incident may not be immediately evident, investigations should continue until this is established. Determining whether a particular event is actually an incident is sometimes a matter of judgement. It may be necessary to collaborate with other technical and information security personnel to make a decision. The key objectives of the meeting for the ISIRT and other conference call attendees should be to:\nPerform an incident analysis based on the evidence provided and the source data. Consider the method of detection and any people involved in the escalation to the ISIRT;\nTriage: Complete an evaluation of the incident severity based on the incident characteristics identified and the escalation criteria as defined in Appendix A. This evaluation will assist in grading incident severity on the scale of 5 levels from \u2018None/Negligible\u2019 to \u2018Very High\u2019. If an incident has characteristics/symptoms that span multiple rows of the table, the incident severity will be determined by the greatest severity rating of all row items. For example, looking at two line-items in the Appendix A matrix, if a security incident has resulted in a significant impact to production (high severity rating) which also affects critical OT systems (very high severity rating), then the incident severity determined by triage should be \u2018Very High\u2019. Appendix B contains an extract of the EMP to be used for determining if \u2018Enhanced Operational\u2019 or \u2018IMT\u2019 levels of incident management need to be applied for IT security related threats as per the requirements of the Emergency Management Plan;  \nClassification: Consult the relevant Playbook for the incident type identified. For example, dealing with the disclosure of login credentials to unauthorised external parties resulting from a targeted email scam, refer to the \u2018Phishing\u2019 playbook. Apply any steps from the Playbook for the ongoing analysis and remediation of the incident;\nContinue triage and include (if necessary) relevant managers/team leads as impacted areas are identified. Refer to details in the Core Service Map Documents;  \nIdentify the primary root cause, data collection and forensics requirements;\nIdentify senior stakeholders and commence notification processes as per the Communications Plan (see Appendix C). Incidents classified as \u2018High\u2019 or \u2018Very High\u2019 will have communications handled as described in Table C1, and \u2018Medium\u2019 or lower handled as described in Table C2.\nEnsure that all decisions and analysis are recorded in the Incident Log.\n\nFor example, in Table 2 below, the determination of the cyber security incident severity is made in step 1 by the ISIRT (or individual team members of the ISIRT) by looking at the impact type and severity ratings shown in Appendix A. Up to this point in time the incident severity has not been confirmed. As such, all incidents should be treated as potentially serious until the triage is complete (requiring ISIRT involvement from the point where the incident report is received). \nA second decision is then required (step 2) to determine if the EMP needs to be invoked. In this case, refer to Appendix B. The table in Appendix B will assist in determining if the EMP provisions should be utilised (i.e. if the table indicates that the EMP incident classification level is \u2018Enhanced Operational\u2019 or \u2018IMT\u2019). Step 3 follows the decision points around whether to engage external parties (by referring to Table 3), and step 4 involves implementing the appropriate Playbook/s. \n\nTable 2\u2013- Triage Evaluation and Escalation Matrix\n\nTo put this in context, refer to Figure 4, which is an extract of the Process Workflow on page 3. For the Detection and Analysis phase of the Incident Response Lifecycle, the four steps in Table 2 have been superimposed onto this diagram for clarity. \nFigure 4 \u2013 Detection and Analysis Phase: Escalation and Engagement\n\nThe criteria for which external agencies to engage and under what circumstances (step 3), can be found in Table 3. This sets out the minimum rating for (a) cyber security incident/s under this framework; and (b) the EMP, needed to engage key external agencies under defined circumstances. For example, when forensic analysis or assistance is required that is not found in-house at Wannon Water, the DPCV cyber security team should be engaged when the minimum cyber incident severity rating is \u2018Moderate\u2019 or higher. Under the EMP requirements, the DPCV cyber security team should be engaged when the classification is \u2018Enhanced Operational\u2019 or higher. Examine Appendices A and B to determine what the escalation requirements are. In the event the decision to escalate comes from one of the two frameworks, but not both, the escalation should proceed.\n\nTable 3 \u2013 Third Party Escalation Decision Matrix \n\n\nIncident Response\u2013- Containment, Eradication & Recovery\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Containment, Eradication & Recovery phase of the Incident Response Lifecycle\n\n\nContainment: Containment is important to ensure that the incident doesn\u2019t overwhelm Wannon Water\u2019s resources or produce additional ongoing impacts to systems or information assets. Containment provides time for developing a tailored remediation strategy. An essential part of containment is decision-making (e.g. whether to shut down a system, disconnect it from a network, disable certain functions etc.). Such decisions are much easier to make if there are predetermined strategies and procedures for containing the incident. Wannon Water manages this risk through the use of detailed Playbook instructions to deal with containment.  \nContainment strategies vary based on the type of incident. For example, the strategy for containing an email-borne malware infection is quite different from that of a network-based dDoS attack. Refer to the correct Playbook for full instructions. \n\nEradication:  After an incident has been contained, eradication may be necessary to eliminate incident symptoms, such as deleting malware, disabling breached user accounts, as well as identifying and mitigating all vulnerabilities that were exploited. During eradication, it is important to identify all affected servers and endpoint devices so that they can be remediated. For some incidents, eradication is either not necessary or is performed during recovery. Follow the Playbook instructions for effective eradication steps. \n\nRecovery: Implement the Playbook requirements to assist with effective incident recovery. Examples may include administrators restoring systems to normal operation and confirming that the systems are functioning normally. Recovery may involve such actions as restoring systems from clean backups, rebuilding systems from scratch, replacing compromised files with clean versions, installing patches, changing passwords, disabling any vulnerable services or components, and tightening network perimeter security (e.g. firewall rulesets and boundary router access control lists). Higher levels of system logging, network monitoring or the deployment of additional security controls are also often part of the recovery process. Once a resource is successfully attacked, it is often attacked again, so full recovery should be robust and completed in conjunction with the Lessons Learned section below. \n\nIn summary, the \u2018Containment, Eradication and Recovery\u2019 phase is a critical part of the Incident Response Lifecycle, the main objectives of which are as follows:\nConfirm the criticality of data and systems effected (referring to the relevant Wannon Water Incident Response Playbook), and assign prioritised remediation tasks and follow-up timeframes so that the relevant support teams can contain the incident;\nRemove all signs, symptoms and causes of the incident from affected systems to ensure the problem is eradicated;\nRecover and restore systems as necessary to resolve the incident; \nProvide updates to identified stakeholders in line with the Communications Plan (see Appendix C), notify any affected users of the incident remediation, and if required, notify the regulatory authorities (dependent on the nature of the incident).\n\nIncident Closure: Close out all linked service tickets updating details as necessary and capturing process remediation requirements as identified. Send incident closure email to relevant staff as identified on the Communications Plan.\n\n\n\nPost Incident Activity / Lessons Learned\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Post Incident Activity phase of the Incident Response Lifecycle\n\n\nOnce the incident has been closed, post incident activities should be conducted and should incorporate a \u2018Lessons Learned\u2019 aspect. A post-incident review should cover off points to enquire whether the incident was managed effectively with a view towards incorporating any potential improvements into the management of future incidents. These should include:\nConfirmation that the incident has been resolved and the Incident Log is reviewed for closure;\nInitial mitigation strategies review\u2013- Was the incident contained? Was process followed, and were the right people involved?\nCommunications review \u2013 were the correct people notified as per the Communications Plan and were updates timely and accurate? Were all incident activities recorded appropriately?\nWere any outstanding or unresolved issues or vulnerabilities captured in the problem management system or risk management system (IRIS)? This will be required for mitigation of like impacts during any future incidents. \nReview remediation activities \u2013 did the restoration activity work as expected? Was required system documentation available and accurate? Are any updates required for the incident response documents and framework? Update process, framework and Playbook documentation accordingly in line with the lessons learned.\nAn effective Incident Response Framework should involve testing the Plan and Playbooks on a regular basis. This can take the form of exercises or simulations of varying complexity (from a simple tabletop simulation right up to a full test of all aspects of incident management just as if a real incident had occurred). The schedule for testing of the plans should be published and adhered to, with the outcomes of the testing feeding into the Lessons Learned component of incident management. \n\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\nWhile every incident may be different, the roles and responsibilities for key personnel are as described in the following RACI Charts (Tables 4a and 4b). The initial incident triage will determine if the Victorian Department of Premier and the Cabinet (DPCV) (or other external party) is required to be engaged to facilitate incident containment and remediation. This determination will be performed by the Information Security Incident Response Team (ISIRT). \n\nTable 4a sets out the roles and responsibilities where it has been determined by the ISIRT that no DPCV Cyber Security Unit (CSU) response is required, and Table 4b where the team has decided that DPCV CSU needs to be engaged to effect incident remediation. The decision to engage or not to engage the CSU should accord with the criteria set out in Table 3 on page 11 but the final decision is entirely at the discretion of the ISIRT and may be dependent on factors such as the requirement for additional or specialist resources.\n\nTable 4a \u2013 Cyber Incident Roles and Responsibilities: No DPCV CSU involvement\n\n\nTable 4b \u2013 Cyber Incident Roles and Responsibilities: DPCV CSU involvement\nR \u2013 Responsible, A-Accountable, C-Consulted, I-Informed\n\n\u2018Wannon Water Technical Teams\u2019 includes any team or function that manages or has responsibility for information resources, technology, platforms or expertise related to the nature of the incident under assessment. \nDEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS\nAvailability\u2013- The information security concept that applies to ensuring that information and information systems are available when needed.\n\nCMDB \u2013 Configuration Management Database\n\nConfidentiality \u2013 The information security concept that applies to preventing unauthorised access to protected and sensitive information assets.\n\nDenial of Service (DOS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) Attack \u2013 An attack intended to overwhelm or overload a system or host in order to cause disruption and service outage.

Stakeholders should be kept informed and up to date on the status and resolution of incidents and potential incidents. \nThe tables below provide guidelines for communicating with stakeholders during cyber security incidents. It provides detail including the target audience and channel of communications.\nCyber Security Incident Communications \u2013 Major or above rating\nThe following notification mechanisms shall apply to significant incidents rated as Major or above that impact multiple Wannon Water sites or systems.\n\nTable C1 \u2013 Communications Plan: High or Very High severity ratings\n\nCyber Security Incident Communications \u2013 Limited or lower rating\nThe following notification mechanisms shall apply to significant incidents with localised impact rated as Limited or lower.\n\nTable C2 \u2013 Communications Plan: Medium or lower severity ratings\n\nTables C1 and C2 refer to the three cyber-security foundational concepts underlying the protection of information assets: confidentiality, integrity and availability. Consult Section 5 \u2013 Key Definitions and Acronyms for a full description of these concepts, and how they apply to data protection. \nExternal Notifications and Communications\nThe VPDSS and the WoVG Cyber Incident Management Plan require the mandatory reporting of any cyber incident impacting an information asset of Business Impact Level (BIL) 2 or higher.  During a cyber incident if the ISIRT determines an impact on an asset of BIL rating 2 or higher, the Information Security Manager or the Chief Information Officer will make a report to:\nDepartment of Government Service Cyber Incident Response Service (DGS CIRS)\nOffice of the Victorian Information Commissioner (OVIC)\nDEECA Water Duty Officer\nThe ISIRT will co-ordinate technical communications with OVIC and CIRS\nAll external media communications will be via Wannon Water standard external communication channels.  ISIRT members will refer all requests for information from external parties to the ISIRT chair.\nNote that if the cyber incident is significant enough to trigger an IMT, the communications provisions of Wannon Water\u2019s Emergency Management Plan will be activated.  The ISIRT will continue to liaise with support agencies on a technical level. \nCurrent reporting obligations are summarised in table C3 below:\nTable C3: Notification requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX D: DEFINITIONS AND INCIDENT CATEGORIES\nKey Definitions\nWannon Water formally define (and differentiate between) security \u2018incidents\u2019 and \u2018events\u2019 in order to establish the scope of response efforts and create a foundation for consistency in the categorization, communication, and handling of security-related events/incidents.\n\nEvent\nAn event is any observable occurrence in a system or network.\nExamples include:\nA user connecting to a file share\nA server receiving a request for a web page\nA user sending an email\nA firewall blocking a connection attempt\nA discrete non operational SCADA alarm (i.e. Communications Fail) \n\n\nIncident\nA security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.\nExamples include:\nAn attacker commands a botnet to send high volumes of connection requests to a web server, causing it to crash.\nUsers are tricked into opening a \u2018quarterly report\u2019 sent via email that is actually malware; running the tool infects their computers and establishes connections with an external host.\nAn attacker obtains sensitive data and threatens that the details will be released publicly if the organization does not pay a designated sum of money or alter a business practice.\nA user provides or exposes sensitive information to others through peer-to-peer file sharing services.\nUsers report abnormal data or control operation to an OT device / system\nSystems report unusual physical access.\n\nIncidents often result in negative consequences to the organization, such as:\nNetwork and/or SCADA system outages\nUnauthorized use of system privileges\nUnauthorized access to sensitive data\nExecution of malware that destroys data\nReduction of water quality\nEnvironmental impacts from a spillage\nAPPENDIX E: INCIDENT LOG TEMPLATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQUICK REFERENCE WORKFLOW \u2013 CYBER SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE\n\n", "Cyber Security Incident Response Plan Framework.DOCX"], ["Purpose\nWannon Water is continually looking to implement and evolve workable and innovative flexibility options consistent with our values and operating environment.\n\nWannon Water believes we can provide additional benefits to employees as they look to deliver on team and organisational objectives.\n\nThis procedure provides guidance to both employees and managers on flexible working. \nScope\nThis procedure applies to all employees and does not alter nor override the terms and conditions of the Wannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020.\n\nProcedure\nWannon Water recognises the potential benefits of providing flexible working arrangements to assist employees with balancing the demands of work with their family and/or personal responsibilities.\n\nFlexible working arrangements can also benefit businesses by increasing staff attraction and retention, decreasing absenteeism, and achieving greater productivity through increased employee job satisfaction.\n\nFlexibility is also an enabler of improved gender outcomes and financial inclusion.\n\nPositive working relationships, trust, performance, and regular communication between employees remains critical to the success of flexible work practices and an organisation\u2019s ability to continue to evolve flexible working.\nPrinciples\nWannon Water\u2019s approach to flexibility is supported by principles that guide employees and managers to have open and transparent conversations around what might and might not be available for each situation.\n\nPrinciples that need to be considered as part of all flexibility opportunities include:\n\nZero Harm and the values of trust and integrity remain at the core of flexible work.\nEvery role should be able to access some form of flexibility, noting not all types of flexibility will work for every role.\nWhat is or is not possible for some, should not limit what is possible for others.\nWannon Water remains predominantly a physically present workforce due to the benefits this brings.\nManagers and employees are to have open conversations and work together to explore what might be workable.\nThere is no expectation that employees must work flexibly, or feel that they need to work flexibly.\nFlexibility will need to reflect and consider our current operating environment and how we work, however this should not be a barrier to considering new opportunities or ways of working.\nFlexibility is subject to review if performance, service, or Zero Harm outcomes are reduced or are at risk or if the needs of the wider team change.\nAn individual\u2019s flexibility agreement must not:\nmaterially change the nature of work for an individual\ncreate ongoing additional work or stress for the individual, manager or other employees\nnegatively impact the ongoing achievement of team and organisational objectives\nrely on a requirement to back fill by contractor, consultant or other means.\n\nTypes of Flexible Working Arrangements\nEmployees can access forms of flexible working arrangements including:\nVariation to work hours (or worksite / remote work)\nAdhoc Flexibility\nPurchased Leave Model (48/52, 49/52, 50/52, 51/52)\nWork From Home (WFH)\nTransition to Retirement \nRegular access of accrued leave.\n\nVariation to work hours (or worksite / remote work)\nAn Individual Flexibility Arrangement is an agreement under Clause 17 of the Wannon Water Enterprise Agreement to vary work hours (and days) on an ongoing basis. \n\nAn employee can apply for an Individual Flexibility Arrangement to amend their start and finish times by a margin of up to 45 minutes or reduce their meal break of 45 minutes by 15 minutes to a minimum unpaid meal break of 30 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, any employee may wish to increase their unpaid meal break to a maximum period of 1 hour 30 minutes.\n\nAn employee can apply to modify the spread of working hours over a working week to increase the number of hours worked on a particular day, (to a maximum of 9.5 hours), therefore lessening the amount of hours worked on other day(s) during the week.\n\nThis arrangement may also cover work site start and finish locations for a particular day or work pattern.\n\nEither party can terminate an Individual Flexibility Working Arrangement giving 28 days\u2019 notice, or earlier by agreement.\n\n\nAdhoc Flexibility (up to one hour)\nNominally there are no provisions for short (up to one hour) absences from the workplace without applying for some type of leave, however, Wannon Water permit short duration ad hoc absences on a \u2018give and take\u2019 basis where a foundation of trust exists.\nEmployees may request to take up to a one-hour absence from the workplace to meet personal commitments on a give and take basis. Employees wishing to access ad hoc flexibility should discuss with and receive permission from their manager before any absence occurs.\n\nManagers are responsible for ensuring that absences are irregular and based on \u2018give and take\u2019. For regular absences an employee will need to apply for an Individual Flexibility Arrangement.\n\n\nPurchased Leave (48/52, 49/52, 50/52, 51/52)\n\nEmployees may request to access a Purchase Leave arrangement, providing the employee the opportunity to purchase up to 4 weeks additional leave, over 12 months, in return for a pro-rata reduction in their salary. Refer the Purchase Leave procedure.\n\nAll employees other than casual or fixed term (less than 12 months) are eligible to apply for Purchased Leave.\n\nPurchased leave enables an employee to request up to four additional weeks of leave over a 12 month period, in return for a pro-rata reduction in their salary. This reduction is averaged out over 12 months and as such, approval is on the basis that it is a 12 month fixed term agreement.\n\nEmployees are to indicate in their required for Purchased leave when the additional leave is planned to be taken. Any   variation to the period of planned leave must be approved by the relevant manager and the Remuneration Coordinator is to be notified in writing of the approved leave amendment.\n\nAn approved Purchased Leave arrangement will remain in place until the 12 month expiry date. In only specific instances, as outlined in the Wannon Water EBA, an employee may apply for the purchased leave model of employment to cease before the nominal expiry date.\n\nAn employee participating in a Purchased Leave Model of Employment will become a fractional employee at the relevant fraction of a full-time workload, with all benefits accruing on that basis over the 12 month period.\n\nThe commencement of a Purchased Leave Model of Employment must be at the start of a pay period or where agreed at the commencement of the next anniversary date of commencement of employment.\n\n\nPurchased leave must be taken within the approved 12 month period in blocks of 5 consecutive leave days. All purchased leave accrued under the Purchased Leave Model of Employment must be used before the 12 month period expires.\n\nAn employee with more than 15 weeks of long service leave accrued will be required to utilise those entitlements before applying for purchased leave.\n\nSuperannuation\nWhere an employee elects to take up the Purchased Leave Model of Employment, Wannon Water shall only be obliged to pay employer superannuation contributions at the applicable pro-rata rate. Where an employee chooses to maintain superannuation contributions at their full-time employment basis rate they can do so, subject to the requirements of the relevant superannuation scheme, via additional pre and/or post tax superannuation contributions.\nCessation of Employment\nAn employee who discontinues their employment whilst on the Purchased Leave Model of Employment will be paid for unused purchased leave at the appropriate rate. Where other entitlements have accrued at the full-time rate, any termination payments will be made at the full-time rate. Where an employee has exceeded their pro rata entitlement to purchased leave, this will be deducted from the employee\u2019s final pay.\nReview of Arrangements\nAn employee may apply for the Purchased Leave Model of Employment arrangement to cease before the 12-month expiry period for circumstances relating to changes of an individual\u2019s personal financial demands or other exceptional circumstances. In these circumstances, the employee will be requested to use all of their additional purchased leave. If an employee has utilised more purchased leave than they have paid for through payroll deductions arrears will continue to be deducted from the employees pay until reconciled.\nParental Leave\nThis flexibility provision aims to provide eligible employees access to parental leave for both primary and secondary caregivers depending on their individual circumstances. Wannon Water also offers flexible return to work options for employees returning from parental leave. For more information, see clause 49 of the Wannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020.\n\nSerious Illness\nThis flexibility provision aims to provide eligible employees access to a variety of leave provisions in times of serious illness. This includes sick leave, long service leave and special leave without pay options. For more information see clause 48, and clause 44 of the Wannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020.\n\nWork From Home (WFH)\nWannon Water is committed to providing a safe and healthy place of work for employees, including those who because of their role and circumstances, can undertake some work from home. Work from home for the purposes of this procedure means an employee\u2019s place of residence and is different to \u201cremote work\u201d or \u201cwork site\u201d. \n\nThere are two categories of WFH that might be available.\n\nAn ongoing arrangement that is formalised through an Individual Flexibility Agreement as part of a normal work pattern; and\n\nAn informal Short Term WFH arrangement in response to a one off or short term change of circumstances.\n\nBoth opportunities require pre-qualification. As per all flexibility options at Wannon Water, any agreement must adhere to Wannon Water\u2019s flexibility principals for them to be successful. WFH is subject to additional criteria including:\n\n\nSuitability of the role for work from home;\nEmployee performance and core competency considerations;\nProductivity will be maintained or increased;\nSuitable work environment at home;\nInternet connectivity, access to Citrix and work systems and programs relative to role requirements;\nImpact on others (team and other internal and external stakeholders);\nAligning where possible to \u201cteam days\u201d;\nCannot be a substitute for caring duties; and\nAny other considerations that may be identified based on individual circumstances.\n\nAll terms and conditions of employment that apply whilst working on-site at Wannon Water remain unchanged and are applicable to work from home. Similarly, all Wannon Water policies and procedures extend to WFH.\n\nEmployees should be aware of the following matters when considering working from home:\n\nWannon Water\u2019s OH&S policies and procedures remain applicable;\nThe requirement for the employee to take reasonable care for their own health & safety and notify their Manager of any risks or injuries;\nSecurity of information, data integrity and privacy;\nWannon Water\u2019s policies and procedures relating to use of IT resources;\nIn cases of a temporary disability which inhibits attendance at work, there is requirement for a medical certificate stating that the employee is able to work safely from home;\nImpact on employee and career development activities and experiences;\nThe need to undertake a WFH e-learn module every 12 months;\nWFH is not provided as an opportunity to avoid workplace conflicts or interpersonal problems that may be occurring; and\nEmployees agree that Wannon Water is not responsible for any liability claim by a third party except to the extent caused by the negligent act, error or omission of Wannon Water.\n\nWork From Home Formal (Ongoing)\nEmployees can apply for up to a maximum of 40% of their current contracted hours as an ongoing work from home arrangement. See below table.\n\n\nIf you wish to access the formal (ongoing) work from home requirements, you should discuss with your manager and complete the Flexible Working Request eform. The eForm will require you to complete a Working from Home Self-Assessment, complete an eLearn module \u201cWorking from Home\u201d, the (ECHO) Ergonomic Assessment and declare that the homework locations meets the requirements of a safe workspace. The flexible work arrangement may not commence until approval is granted.\n\nThe maximum percentage may vary for different individuals and teams once the principles and criteria are considered. This will need to be assessed for decision by the manager of the individual or team at that time.\n\nThe following additional considerations should form part of an assessment for exceeding the 40% maximum work from home:\n\nLength of tenure and experience\nType of employment (fixed term, casual, ongoing)\nImpact of increased work from home on team collaboration and the employee\u2019s deliverables\nNeed for employee to attend the onsite workplace to undertake work\nNeed for employee to access equipment or machinery to undertake work\nImpact on face-to-face interaction for coaching, counselling, building rapport, training, negotiation or critical decision making\nMedical/Mental Health conditions (evidence from medical practitioner)\nResidential address of the employee\nAny other considerations that may be identified based on individual circumstances\n\nFollowing assessment, the manager will consult with People & Wellbeing to ensure a consistency in application across the workplace prior to approval. Additionally, the arrangement should be reviewed as required and as a minimum at interim and annual review periods to ensure it is still working effectively for both parties and noted in review notes.\n\nAn Individual Flexibility Agreement - WFH should aim to ensure the employees work pattern includes attending the physical workspace on \u201cteam days\u201d (or at a minimum \u201chalf days\u201d) where possible. Team days are those days determined by the Manager where most of the team should attempt to be physically present to support cohesion and deliverables. Every team is different and therefore this currently remains at the discretion of management.\n\nSwitching agreed WFH days is available within your normal work pattern to accommodate business or personal requirements and will require manager approval.\n\nShort Term - Work From Home\nShort term WFH is the opportunity for employees pre-qualified to work from home to do so in response to a one off or a short-term change of circumstances for either a part or full day(s).\n\nShort term WFH may be available to employees depending on circumstances, workload and work requirements. Examples may include training, work related study, project work or contractors servicing your home which require you to be present to allow access.\n\nShort Term WFH is not suitable nor available for supporting caring duties but may be available where only light supervision is required.\n\n\u201cLight supervision\u201d is defined by Wannon Water as when an employee\u2019s circumstances mean they might need to be at their home to supervise a member(s) of their immediate household however they are able to effectively work with very minimal disruption to the workday. To qualify, the employee must have the ability to attend meetings and be available as required for extended periods of time. In short, they only require intermittent and infrequent engagement with those they might be supervising as they are relatively self-sufficient.\n\nThis is different to \u201ccaring\u201d where caring requires the provision of ongoing care and attention to another person who is wholly or substantially dependent on the employee for their day-to-day activities. The duty of care from the carer means it is not reasonable for the person being cared for to be left alone for any extended period of time as they are unable to care for themselves and require constant monitoring. In these circumstances, leave provision or alternative flexibility options may be accessed.\n\nIf you wish to access Short term work from home, you should discuss your request with your Manager and complete the Short-Term Work From Home Pre-qualification Checklist. To meet the pre- qualifications requirements the checklist will request you to complete a Working from Home Self- Assessment, complete an eLearn module \u201cWorking from Home\u201d, the (ECHO) Ergonomic Assessment and declare that the home work locations meets the requirements of a safe workspace. The completed checklist must be provided to People & Wellbeing for review, confirmation and filing prior to commencing this form of WFH.\n\nPeople & Wellbeing encourage you to prequalify in anticipation that you may wish to access Short term WFH arrangements. Requests to your manager should occur at your earliest opportunity. Late requests may not be able to be approved due to organisational requirements.\n\nPerformance\n\nEmployees with an annual performance score lower than 60% in the most recent annual review will require approval from People & Wellbeing to access WFH.\n\nEmployees who have had formal conduct or performance management in the preceding 12 months, are not eligible for WFH without approval from People & Wellbeing.\n\nFamily and Personal Circumstances\n\nEmployees who have personal responsibilities such as caring will be expected to manage these responsibilities in a way that allows them to successfully meet their employment obligations. Working from home is not a substitute for regular childcare or other carer\u2019s responsibilities. Employees who work from home must ensure that they have suitable childcare/carer arrangements in place.\n\nSchool Holidays\n\nWannon Water will make available Short Term WFH over school holidays subject to the normal requirements of WFH approval. Up to 100% of an employee work pattern may be available for a maximum of 2 weeks per holiday period, noting this may not be possible for all teams or employees where operational requirements may not allow or need to be shared by team members.\n\nReturn to work after illness or injury\n\nIn cases of an illness or temporary disability which inhibits attendance at work, the Manager should consult with People & Wellbeing to determine if a Return-to-Work Program is needed and/or a medical certificate is required stating that the employee is able to work safely from home.\n\n\n\n\nWork from home conditions\n\nWorking from home can only occur between the hours of 6.00am and 6.00pm, Monday to Friday. Any overtime hours of work must be approved in advance.\n\nWork from home opportunities will not extend to payment of an employee\u2019s expenses such as internet, phone, printing and power. Should an employee wish to utilise a work from home arrangement, it is recommended that they speak to their accountant as they may be able to seek reimbursement of these costs through the Australian Tax Office.\n\nProvision of furniture, equipment and other items\n\nAny employee who successfully applies to WFH will be provided with a laptop, additional screen, headset, mouse, keyboard and the option to have a suitable work chair provided where a new employee has an approved ongoing work from home arrangement in place. Desks or additional equipment remain the responsibility of employees.\n\nEmployees utilising Short Term WFH will be provided with a laptop, headset, mouse and keyboard only.\n\nThe employee agrees to notify Wannon Water within 24 hours, if any problems or difficulties arise with the operation of the furniture or equipment and allow access to replace, service or repair the equipment. Any failed equipment is to be returned to the Wannon Water for repairs.\n\nThose who cease a WFH arrangement are required to return all WFH peripherals.\n\nInsurance \u2013 WFH\n\nThe employee must have current household insurance and agree to inform their household insurer of the home-based work arrangement. The employee must also provide a copy of their insurance \u2018certificate of currency\u2019 to Wannon Water. Wannon Water is not responsible for any liability claim by a third party except to the extent caused by the negligent act error or omission of Wannon Water.\n\nApproval / Disapproval\n\nThe decision to approve a request to work from home rests with the relevant Branch or equivalent Manager or People & Wellbeing where this is required. If necessary, the Branch or equivalent Manager will consult with the People & Wellbeing to determine other potential organisational impacts prior to making a decision.\n\nFollowing in-principle approval, the commencement of an agreement is still subject to a satisfactory workplace self-assessment inspection, provision of satisfactory household insurance, a Workstation Self-Assessment Checklist, work from home e-learn module and the setting of agreement parameters which from part of the application. All working from home agreements must be approved before the arrangement commences.\n\nWhere a WFH application has been disapproved, reasons for the refusal are to be discussed with the applicant by the manager.\n\nIf an employee is not satisfied with their manager\u2019s assessment, they may discuss their circumstances with People & Wellbeing.\n\nTransition to Retirement (TTR)\nTTR allows for ongoing employees who are approaching retirement, the opportunity to plan their departure from Wannon Water, providing mutual benefit to both the employee and Wannon Water. Wannon Water encourages employees to consider entering into a TTR, using the flexible working arrangements outlined in this procedure. \n\nRequest to Transition to Retirement\nA request to TTR is to be to submitted via a Flexible Working Arrangement eForm. This request will specify the date at which employment with Wannon Water will end and cannot normally be extended or renewed beyond that date. \n\nThe period of the TTR is generally up to 12 months and no more than two years and can be terminated by:\ndate of expiry being reached.\nthe employee i.e. by resignation before date of expiry.\nWannon Water under circumstances where employment can be terminated i.e. serious misconduct.\n\nUtilising annual or long service leave during a TTR\n\nWhen requesting a TTR, employees must specify blocks of leave exceeding 3 weeks, that will be taken during the entirety of the TTR. Variations to the planned leave requires approval from the relevant manager, considering organisational impact and standard leave application processes. Approved changes must be notified to People & Wellbeing in writing.\nAnnual or Long Service Leave cannot extend beyond the employee\u2019s final day of physically attending work or performing duties for the organisation.\nIn the instance of illness during leave, employees may convert approved accrued leave to sick leave, if the following are met:\nA medical certificate from a qualified practitioner is provided for the period of illness or injury occurring during the annual or long service leave.\nThe manager is notified within 24 hours of the sick leave, with the certificate submitted within the relevant pay period. \n\nRefusal of request for Flexibility Working Arrangements\nA request for flexible working arrangements will not be unreasonably refused and will be assessed in a timely manner. The employee will receive a written response within 21 days of submitting a request including any reasons for refusing a request (if applicable).  (See Appendix).\n\nReasonable business grounds for refusing a request for flexible working arrangements include:\nThe new arrangement would be too costly for the employer.\nThere is no capacity to change the working arrangements of other employees to accommodate the new working arrangements.\nIt would be impractical to change the working arrangements of others, or to recruit new employees.\nThe new working arrangement would be likely to result in significant loss of efficiency or productivity or have a negative impact on customer service. \n\nIn assessing a request for flexible working arrangements, the following will be considered (where applicable): \nThe employee\u2019s circumstances, including the nature of their caring responsibilities.\nThe consequence for the employee of approving or not approving the arrangement.\nThe benefits to the individual and Wannon Water. \nThe availability of appropriately skilled replacement employees. \nThe health and safety of both the employee and other employees potentially impacted by the flexible working arrangements (for example mental health of the individual or stress caused to other employees).\nAny risks associated with the request.\nThe intended duration of the arrangement. \nWhether the employee has other entitlements available that would be more appropriate in the circumstances; and \nWhether a trial period is required to test the flexible working arrangement and, if so, how long it is required to evaluate the success or otherwise of the new arrangement.\n\nPeople & Wellbeing may recommend an alternative arrangement, that may be appropriate for an employee based on some or all the criteria outlined above.\n\nRequests that are supported by managers on the provision that the flexibility will be back filled by a contractor or consultant, or at additional cost to Wannon Water, will not be approved unless there are extenuating circumstances.\n\n\nReview, vary or cease a flexible working arrangement\n\nAll long term flexible working arrangements should be regularly reviewed. It is recommended that long term flexible working arrangements be reviewed, initially after a period of three months and thereafter at a minimum annually or on an as needs basis based on the operational requirements of the business or personal circumstances of the employee. \n\nFlexible working arrangements can be altered to meet the changing operational requirements of the workplace. \n\nEither party may propose a variation to the flexible working arrangements. Where a current arrangement can no longer be accommodated on reasonable business grounds, the reasons why and available options should be discussed with the employee. It is recommended,that written notice is provided where a regular or ongoing arrangement needs to be changed at least 28 days prior to the change.\n\nRoles and responsibilities\n\nDefinitions \n\n\n\nGovernance\n\nDocument version history\n\n\n\nAppendix 1 \u2013 Document Framework\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Flexible Working Arrangements Procedure.DOCX"], ["Purpose\nThis policy states how our organisation:\nresponds to offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality; and\nprovides, benefits and hospitality. \nThis policy is supports individuals and Wannon Water to avoid conflicts of interest and maintain high levels of integrity and public trust. Wannon Water has issued this policy to support behaviour consistent with the \u201cCode of Conduct for Victorian Public Sector Employees\u201d and the \u201cCode of Conduct for Directors of Victorian Public Entities\u201d (the Code). All employees are required under clause 1.2 of the Code to comply with this policy.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all workplace participants including Directors, employees, contractors, consultants and any individuals or groups undertaking activity for or on behalf of Wannon Water.\nPolicy statement\nThis policy has been developed in accordance with requirements outlined in the minimum accountabilities for the management of gifts, benefits and hospitality issued by the Victorian Public Sector Commission. \nWannon Water is committed to and will uphold the following principles in applying this policy:\nImpartiality - individuals have a duty to place the public interest above their private interests when carrying out their official functions. They will not accept gifts, benefits or hospitality that could raise a reasonable perception of, or actual, bias or preferential treatment. Individuals do not accept offers from those about whom they are likely to make business decisions. \nAccountability - individuals are accountable for:\ndeclaring all non-token offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality; \ndeclining non-token offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality, or where an exception applies under this policy, seeking approval to accept the offer; and\nthe responsible provision of gifts, benefits and hospitality.\nIndividuals with direct reports are accountable for overseeing management of their direct reports\u2019 acceptance or refusal of non-token gifts, benefits and hospitality, modelling good practice and promoting awareness of gifts, benefits and hospitality policies and processes.\nIntegrity -  individuals strive to earn and sustain public trust through providing or responding to offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality in a manner that is consistent with community expectations. Individuals will refuse any offer that may lead to an actual, perceived or potential conflict of interest. \n\nThis is further expressed through Wannon Water\u2019s value of integrity, and demonstrated with the behaviours of:\nBeing open, honest and impartial\nBeing accountable for the commitments made ;and\nBeing fair to myself and others. \nRisk-based approach - Wannon Water, through its policies, processes and Audit and Risk Management Committee, will ensure gifts, benefits and hospitality risks are appropriately assessed and managed. Individuals with direct reports will ensure they are aware of the risks inherent in their team\u2019s work and functions and monitor the risks to which their direct reports are exposed. \nMinimum Accountabilities\nUnder the Instructions supporting the Standing Directions of the Minister for Finance 2016, the Victorian Public Sector Commission (VPSC) has set binding minimum accountabilities for the appropriate management of gifts, benefits and hospitality. These can be found at the .\nResponsibilities\nImplementation\nManagement of offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality\nThis section sets out the process for accepting, declining and recording offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality. Any exceptions to this process must have the prior written approval of the Managing Director.\n Thanks is enough\nWe encourage everyone to help develop a culture of \u2018thanks is enough\u2019. Our aim is to move to a culture in which offers are not accepted even if they are permitted under this policy. \n\nConflict of interest and reputational risks\nWhen deciding whether to accept an offer, individuals should consider if the offer could be perceived as influencing them in performing their duties or lead to reputational damage. The more valuable the offer, the more likely a conflict of interest or reputational risk exists.\n\nFigure 1. GIFT test\nThis table is a useful tool when considering how to respond to a gift offer.\nRequirement for refusing offers (Prohibited offers)\nIndividuals should consider the GIFT test in Figure 1 and the requirements below to help decide whether to refuse an offer. Individuals are to refuse offers:\nlikely to influence them, or be perceived to influence them, in the course of their duties or that raise an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest\ncould bring them, Wannon Water, or the public sector into disrepute \nmade by a person or organisation about which they will likely make or influence a decision (this also applies to processes involving grants, sponsorship, regulation, enforcement or licensing), particularly offers:\nmade by a current or prospective supplier;\nmade during a procurement or tender process by a person or organisation involved in the process\nlikely to be a bribe or inducement to make a decision or act in a particular way \nthat extend to their relatives or friends\nof money, or used in a similar way to money, or something easily converted to money\nwhere, in relation to hospitality and events, the organisation will already be sufficiently represented to meet its business needs \nwhere acceptance could be perceived as endorsement of a product or service, or acceptance would unfairly advantage the sponsor in future procurement decisions\nmade by a person or organisation with a primary purpose to lobby Ministers, Members of Parliament or public sector organisations\nmade in secret.\n\n Attempts to bribe\nIf an individual considers they have been offered a bribe or inducement, the offer must be reported to the Managing Director or their delegates who should report any criminal or corrupt conduct to Victoria Police, the Independent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission or the Victorian Ombudsman.\nIndependent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission Victoria (IBAC)\nLevel 1, North Tower, 459 Collins Street, Melbourne Victoria 3000\nGPO Box 24234, Melbourne Victoria, 3001\nInternet:   \nPhone:   1300 735 135\nEmail: see the website above for the secure email disclosure process, which also provides for anonymous disclosures.\n\nThe Victorian Ombudsman\nLevel 2, 570 Bourke Street\nMelbourne, Vic. 3000\nPhone: (03) 9613 6222\nEmail: \n\nToken offers \nA token offer is an offer of a gift, benefit or hospitality that is of inconsequential or trivial value to both the person making the offer and the recipient. It may include promotional items such as pens and notepads, and modest hospitality that would be considered a basic courtesy, such as light refreshments during a meeting. \nThe minimum accountabilities state that token offers cannot be worth more than $50. \n\nNon-token offers\nIndividuals can only accept non-token offers if they have a legitimate business benefit. All accepted non-token offers must be approved in writing by the individual\u2019s manager or organisational delegate, recorded in the gifts, benefits and hospitality register and be consistent with the following requirements:\nit does not raise an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest or have the potential to bring the individual, Wannon Water, or the public sector into disrepute; and\nthere is a legitimate business reason for acceptance. It is offered in the course of the individual\u2019s official duties, relates to the individual\u2019s responsibilities and has a benefit to the organisation, public sector or the State.\nIndividuals may be offered a gift or hospitality where there is no opportunity to seek written approval from their manager prior to accepting. For example, they may be offered a wrapped gift that they later identify as being a non-token gift. In these cases, the individual must seek approval from their manager within five business days.\nWhere the gift would likely bring you or the organisation into disrepute, the organisation should return the gift. If it represents a conflict of interest for you, the organisation should either return the gift or transfer ownership to the organisation to mitigate this risk.\n\nRecording non-token offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality\nAll non-token offers, whether accepted or declined, must be recorded in the gifts, benefits and hospitality register. The business reason for accepting the non-token offer must be recorded in the register using the  with sufficient detail to link the acceptance to the individual\u2019s work functions and benefit to Wannon Water, public sector or State. \nIndividuals should consider the following examples of acceptable and unacceptable levels of detail to be included in the register when recording the business reason:\nUnacceptable\n\u201cNetworking\u201d\n\u201cMaintaining stakeholder relationships\u201d\nAcceptable\n\u201cIndividual is responsible for evaluating and reporting on the outcomes of Wannon Water\u2019s sponsorship of Event A. Individual attended Event A in an official capacity and reported back to the Wannon Water on the event.\u201d \n\u201cIndividual presented to a visiting international delegation. The delegation presented the individual with a cultural item worth an estimated $200. Declining the gift would have caused offence. The gift was accepted on behalf of Wannon Water\u201d.\nAccess to the register is restricted to relevant persons within the Wannon Water.\nWannon Water\u2019s Audit and Risk Management Committee will receive a report at least annually on the administration and quality control of the gifts, benefits and hospitality policy, processes and register. The report will include analysis of Wannon Water\u2019s gifts, benefits and hospitality risks (including multiple offers from the same source and offers from business associates), risk mitigation measures and any proposed improvements.\nThe public register will contain a subset of the information detailed in Wannon Water\u2019s internal register, in accordance with Victorian Public Sector Commission guidance. \n\nOwnership of gifts offered to individuals\nNon-token gifts with a legitimate business benefit that have been accepted by an individual for their work or contribution may be retained by the individual where the gift is not likely to bring them or Wannon Water into disrepute, and where their manager or organisational delegate has provided written approval. Employees must transfer official gifts or any gift of cultural significance or significant value to Wannon Water. \n\nRepeat offers\nReceiving multiple offers (token or non-token) from the same person or organisation can generate a stronger perception that the person or organisation could influence you. Individuals should refuse repeat offers from the same source if they create a conflict of interest or may lead to reputational damage.\n\n\nCeremonial gifts\nCeremonial gifts are official gifts provided as part of the culture and practices of communities and government, within Australia or internationally. Ceremonial gifts are the property of the organisation, irrespective of value, and should be accepted by individuals on behalf of Wannon Water. The receipt of ceremonial gifts should be recorded on the Gifts, Benefits and Hospitality internal register but this information does not need to be published online (Public Register).\n\nHospitality provided by Victorian public sector organisations\nVictorian public sector organisations may provide hospitality to stakeholders, as part of their functions. When offered hospitality by a Victorian public sector organisation, individuals should consider the requirements of the minimum accountabilities.\nAccepted hospitality offered by a Victorian public sector organisation as part of official business does not need to be declared or reported, where the reason for the individual\u2019s attendance is consistent with Wannon Water\u2019s functions and objectives and with the individual\u2019s role.\n\nManagement of the provision of gifts, benefits and hospitality\nThis section sets out the requirements for providing gifts, benefits and hospitality.\nFigure 2. HOST test\n\n\nRequirements for providing gifts, benefits and hospitality\nGifts, benefits and hospitality may be provided when welcoming guests, to facilitate the development of business relationships, further public sector business outcomes and to celebrate achievements.\nWhen deciding whether to provide gifts, benefits or hospitality or the type of gift, benefit or hospitality to provide, individuals must ensure: \nany gift, benefit or hospitality is provided for a business reason that furthers the conduct of official business or other legitimate organisational goals, or promotes and supports government policy objectives and priorities;\nthat any costs are proportionate to the benefits obtained for the State, and would be considered reasonable in terms of community expectations (the \u2018HOST\u2019 test at Figure 2 is a good reminder of what to think about in making this assessment); and\nit does not raise an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest.\n\nContaining costs\nIndividuals should contain costs involved with providing gifts, benefits and hospitality wherever possible, and should comply with the financial probity and efficient use of resources guidance outlined in the Code of Conduct for Victorian Public Sector Employees, or the Code of Conduct for Directors of Public Entities. The following questions may be useful to assist individuals to decide on the type of gift, benefit or hospitality to provide:\nWill the cost of providing the gift, benefit or hospitality be proportionate to the potential benefits?\nIs an external venue necessary or does the organisation have facilities to host the event? \nIs the proposed catering or hospitality proportionate to the number of attendees?\nDoes the size of the event and number of attendees align with intended outcomes?\nIs the gift symbolic, rather than financial, in value?\nWill providing the gift, benefit or hospitality be viewed by the public as excessive?\n Alleged breaches\nIf employees may have breached this policy they should notify their manager in writing immediately. This enables assessment on how best to mitigate the risk \u2013 for example, arranging to return the gift.\n\nOur response will be fair, reasonable and proportionate. There will be a graduated approach and in some instances, no action will be taken. \n\nAny action as a result of a breach will be in line with the . If a criminal offence may have occurred, the Victorian or Federal Police may investigate and prosecute. \n\nAuthorising Officer and Organisational Delegate\nThe policy is issued under the authority of the Board and is subject to annual review.  The organisational delegate is the Managing Director.\n\nA conflict of interest resulting from the acceptance of a gift, benefit or hospitality is not always clear to those who have them. Individuals who are unsure about accepting a gift, benefit or hospitality, or the application of this policy, should ask their manager, General Manager, Managing Director or Board Secretary for advice.\nDefinitions \n\n\nGovernance\n\nDocument version history\nOnly the Board may authorise development and approval of Board policies. The policy development and approval process is coordinated and documented in the agenda and minutes of the Board. For document control purposes, the approver (Policy Owner) detailed above is the relevant employee responsible for managing the Policy on behalf of the Board.\n\n", "Gifts Benefits and Hospitality Policy - BOARD.DOCX"], ["Purpose\nThe purpose of this procedure is to clearly describe how hazards are identified, reported, assessed and controlled within Wannon water. \nScope\nThis procedure applies to all functions, sites and systems of work undertaken within Wannon Water by employees, contractors and the general public.\n\nA hazard is any object or any work practice that has the potential to cause:\n\ninjury or illness (to employees, contractors, visitors or general public), including both physical and psychosocial \nenvironmental or natural asset damage\nproblems or issues with water quality\nproperty and/or infrastructure damage or loss\ndisruption to service supply\ndamage or loss of ICT networks\nloss or damage to data (hard copy or electronic)\nunauthorised access to any facility or asset managed by Wannon Water\nenvironmental or natural asset damage, or\nan impact on product quality\nWannon Water\u2019s reputation to be compromised.\n\nThe Hazard Reporting process can also be used for identifying opportunities, including physical, procedural and system improvements. \nProcedure \u2013 Hazard Reporting Process\nThe purpose of hazard reporting is to work out the underlying causes of the hazard which will; \n\nprevent any incident that may result from the hazard\ncorrect the problem and to prevent a recurrence\nexplore opportunities to improve our processes and systems \nallow analysis of data.\n\nHazards can be identified in several ways, including Workplace inspections, Task Risk Assessment (TRA/JSA), HACCP Processes, Audit programme, day to day business activities (e.g. the use of procedures).\n\nWhere an exisiting process, i.e., Workplace Inspections, TRA, audit etc., results in a hazard being identified, raised and actioned, there is no need to log an additional hazard. The system can be used where beneficial but is not required. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an overview of the process for hazard reporting;\n\n\nHazard Identification and Reporting \nIt is the responsibiltiy of all employees to report any hazards they come across. All identified hazards should be reported as soon as practicable into RiskWare. Guide on how to report a hazard can be found in Content Manager; .\n\nThe person who will own/manage the hazard should be consulted as part of the process to ensure they understand the details of the issue and are the correct person to manage it.  \n\nHazard Assessment \nAll reported hazards need to be assessed in RiskWare. Our target is to complete a hazard assessment within 30 days of the hazard being reported. \n\nThe hazard assessment includes assessing what action has already been taken, what the risk is at the time of the hazard being reported, control measures required and what the risk is/will be after controls have been implemented. Guidance is available on how to complete this in RiskWare (). \n\nRisk Rating \nHazards are assessed against our operational risk consequence categories and risk matrix (). These are programmed into RiskWare and can also be found in so:control. This step involves:\n\nDetermining the likelihood that an incident will occur\nDetermining the consequences of the incident\nCalculating the risk score (which may range from low to extreme)\n\nImplementing Control Measures \nAll hazards must be managed as per our Risk Appetite using the following hierarchy of control, as far as reasonably practicable. \n\nThe hierarchy of controls has five levels of actions to reduce or remove hazards and the levels are ranked from highest level of protection and reliability through to lowest. Elimination is the most effective control measure and should always be used where possible. If it is not possible to eliminate the hazard, then you must eliminate as many of the risks associated with the hazard as possible.\n\nAdministrative and PPE controls are less effective and reliable controls. These should only be used: \nas last resorts when there are no other practical control measures available\nas an interim measure until introducing a more effective way of controlling the risk\nto increase the effectiveness of higher-level control measures\nin addition to other controls \n\n\n\nCommunication of Hazards \nIt\u2019s important that we always share information about hazards with other people where it might affect them. This is to ensure other areas can understand and apply any outcomes or learnings where applicable hazards may exist. Hazards/learnings can be communicated in a number of ways, inlcuding: \n\nOHS Representatives / OHS Consultative Committee \nSafety or Zero Harm Alerts \nTeam/Toolbox meetings \nWatershed post, emails etc. \nMonitor and Review\nAfter implementing a control measure, it should never be assumed that the control measure is effective. New control measures may also introduce hazards of their own.\n\nFor this reason, all hazards and controls should be assessed on an ongoing basis.\n\nRoles and responsibilities\nDefinitions \nGovernance\n\nDocument version history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Hazard Reporting Procedure.DOCX"], ["Purpose\nThe purpose of this procedure is to describe how incidents are to be reported, assessed for consequence, investigated and actioned.\nAn incident is an unintended event that disturbs normal operations. This event has resulted in or has the potential to result in adverse consequences to persons, the environment, drinking water quality or a combination of these; this also includes any significant deviation from an agreement, process or procedure.\nHaving an effective incident reporting and response process enables us to meet our legislative and performance obligations but also to ensure that we can learn from previous incidents and where appropriate identify controls to prevent reoccurrence.\nWannon Water is exposed to numerous different incidents of varying severity levels ranging from incidents that can be managed at a local level (e.g., site) to incidents that could involve a statewide response.\nScope\n\nThis procedure applies to all incidents, confirmed complaints and near misses including:\nSafety, health(well-being), environmental and water quality\nProcess safety (plant, equipment \u2013 integrity and damage)\nFinancial Loss (theft, fraud)\nNon-compliance with legal or regulatory obligations\nCommunity, social and reputational\nExternal stakeholder complaints\nSecurity (including cyber security).\n\nIt covers all functions, sites and systems of work undertaken within Wannon Water by employees, contractors and the general public.\n\nAll incidents are to be investigated, to the extent necessary, to determine the contributing factors and root causes.

Upon the identification of an incident, the persons responding shall ensure that the scene is made safe and (if relevant) by controlling and containing the hazard (for example-substance spill). The relevant site emergency response plan is to be initiated for initial incident management in the event of an emergency.  \n\nFirst Aid\n\nIndividuals first on the scene of an incident involving an injury must, as far as reasonably practicable and trained to do so should provide first aid and call for assistance.\n\nIs An Emergency Response Required?\n\nDoes the situation constitute an emergency? An emergency response must be called if someone is seriously hurt, people are at immediate risk, or plant is endangered. \n\nThese contact details, the responsibilities of the caller, and the duties of the emergency response team are to be located in site-specific Emergency Response Plan or the Emergency Management plan or other response plans. \n\nSecuring the site \n\nFollowing an incident, the supervisor, team leader, senior person, or emergency response person should:\n\n\u2022\tInitiate the site Emergency Response Plan as required\n\u2022\tWhere safe to do so, make the area safe and prevent escalation of the situation\n\u2022\tEvacuate people as necessary\n\u2022\tIf trained provide the necessary first-aid and medical care to the injured, account for all people\n\u2022\tPreserve the incident scene in a manner consistent with their responsibility to retain valuable information for the incident investigation. \n\u2022\tNotify management as required.\n\n\nShould Related Works be suspended?\n \t\nThe decision to suspend works associated with the incident is the immediate responsibility of the Job Owner/Supervisor. The Job Owner/Supervisor must suspend works if: \n\n\u2022\ta serious injury or fatality has occurred \n\u2022\ta reportable event occurs as defined in law (see Appendix 1) \n\u2022\tthe continuation of work may jeopardise the incident investigation.\n\n\u2003\n3.2\tReporting\n\nWhat Must Be Reported? \n\nAny and all of the following events must be reported in Wannon Water\u2019s Incident Reporting system: \n\nincidents resulting in injury \nnear miss \ndrinking water quality event exceeding the appropriate regulatory limit\nenvironmental incidents \nbreaches of trade waste agreements\nevent(s) that may impact on plant and equipment integrity (e.g. Cyber related attacks Data \nBreach, loss of cardax card, Third Party Data Breach, Ransomware, Phishing, System Compromise, Denial of Service (DOS)\nnon-compliance with procedures, and legal or regulatory obligations \nevent(s) that may adversely impact on the community, or our reputation \ntheft or similar misconduct \nsecurity breach\nexternal stakeholder complaints that are deemed to involve abuse, harassment or incivility and impact on the health & wellbeing of our employees\n\nWho Must Report? \t\n\nThe responsibility to report events rests with us all. In practice, any person who knows of an event must take reasonable steps to verify that the event has been reported to the relevant line manager. To knowingly fail to report an event is regarded as a serious failure to fulfil one\u2019s duty of care and may result in disciplinary action. \n\nVerbal Reporting to Line Management \n\nWhilst the workflow within the incident reporting system will issue emails to your Line Manager \u2013 It is good practice to also verbally notify your Line Manager or Branch Manager when an incident occurs.\n\n \nLessons Learnt\n\nThe Investigation lead is responsible for ensuring any lessons identified are shared with relevant teams and departments. \nThe approval to share externally should come from the Investigation lead.\n\n\n\nResponse \nDetermining Incident Category, Response and Type of Investigation - Table 1\n. \nNote: If the incident is a notifiable incident, the Manager Safety, Risk and Resilience must ensure that Wannon Water\u2019s Legal Services team is informed to ensure that any requirement to maintain legal professional privilege is identified and considered\nDepartment of Health and or EPA notifiable incidents will be led by Branch Manager Operations or Delegate \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoles and responsibilities\nSpecify actions and responsibilities for particular positions to ensure that the policy aligns with relevant legislation, is implemented and monitored and is reviewed to evaluate its continuing effectiveness.\n\n\nDefinitions \n\nGovernance\n\n\n\n\nDocument version history\n\n", "Incident Reporting and Response Procedure.DOCX"], ["PURPOSE\nTo outline the procedure covering the security of Information Technology (IT) systems at Wannon Water.\n\nThe IT security model is designed to protect the information systems and information assets operated by Wannon Water by restricting access to authorised personnel and by adopting industry security best practices and standards.\n\nWherever technically possible, Wannon Water systems will reflect the security guidelines set out in both the Victorian Protective Data Security Standards and the Australian Cyber Security Centre\u2019s Essential 8 Cyber Security Controls.\n\nOther relevant standards and industry practices may be applied as required.\n\n\nSCOPE\nThis procedure is divided into the following sections: \n\nNetwork security\nSystem security\nEquipment Security\nInformation and Data Security\nOther Security issues\n\nThe procedure covers the security practices which must be applied when using all IT systems.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS \nNetwork Security\nNew employees\nFollowing a request from the People and Resilience team, access to the Wannon Water computer network is granted to a new employee by the IT Team.   A new Active Directory account (e.g. john.smith@wannonwater.com.au) and temporary password is created for the employee.  \n\nAll new employees will receive an IT induction on commencement.  This induction will include an Information Technology and Systems security component.  During this induction the employee will be shown how to change the temporary password to a private, secure password.  The procedure for network password creation and management can be found in the Password Procedure.\n\nTypically, new employees will not be provided access to any part of Wannon Water\u2019s IT/ IS systems until they complete this induction.\n\nTerminating employees\nUpon the termination of an employee, the People and Resilience Team will immediately notify the IT Team, who will immediately disable the employee\u2019s Active Directory account and notify system owners of any non - Active Directory integrated systems to disable the employees access.\n\n\nConfidentiality of usernames and passwords\nUser Names and passwords are confidential.  As such, they must not be communicated to any other person (internal or external to Wannon Water.  They must not be written down.  \nUsers other than IT team members must never knowingly login to a system as another user.\n\nForgotten passwords\nIf forgotten, passwords can be reset by contacting the IT Team (see the Password Procedure for details).\n\nSharing computers\nEmployees must not use a computer that another employee is currently logged on to.  If the use of a computer is required, then the previous user must first be logged off.  The system \"assumes\" that the person at the keyboard is the owner of the User Name.  All session activity will be logged against that User Name and the owner will be responsible for any breaches of security.\nThis includes connecting to Citrix sessions from a terminal, laptop or tablet device under any credentials other than the connecting users own credentials.\n\nUse of non Wannon Water issued computers\nAccess to the Wannon Water computer network must only be through authorised Wannon Water equipment and procedures unless otherwise approved by the Information Technology Operations Manager.\nNote that this does not include publically published web services specifically provided for third party use, not does it include approved contractors using their own equipment to remotely access Wannon Water resources.\n\nIn rare instances particular items of equipment not purchased or supported by Wannon Water may be \u201cauthorised\u201d for use with Wannon Water information Systems, typically for brief and specific periods of use.  Examples of this include laptop or customised network devices used by consultants during maintenance or commissioning of assets.  In such instance the use of external equipment must be authorised by the Information Technology Operations Manager, or in the case of OT consultants, the Operations Digital Product Line Manager.\n\nNote that consultants may connect devices to the pre-secured \u201cguest\u201d WiFi network provided at Wannon Water sites.  \n\n\n\n\nAccessing Third Party computer networks or systems\nIt is not permitted to access a Third Party network or system using Wannon Water equipment, other than to allow access to Wannon Water services \u2013 i.e.connecting to home wifi or hotel wifi to allow access to Wannon Water\u2019s published systems.\n\n\nAccessing the Internet\nAccessing the Internet must be done using an approved method. For more information on authorised Internet use, see the Internet Usage Procedure.\n\nThird Party access to the Wannon Water network\nThird Party access to the Wannon Water network must follow the Remote Access (Third Parties) Procedure.\n Please refer to Remote access for third parties procedure for more detail.\n\n\n\nSystem Security\nAll systems (e.g. Finance One, Aquarate, Conquest, Fulcrum, Records Manager, Clear SCADA, etc\u2026) have an information system administrator and associated information asset steward Note in some instances the same officer fills both the roles of information system administrator and information asset steward.\n As per the Information Access Procedure, information asset stewards are accountable for ensuring appropriate access is granted to end users.  \nInformation system administrators are responsible for implementing and maintaining security access as approved by information asset stewards. \n\nSecurity access to systems will be routinely reviewed. \n\nSystem User Name and password maintenance\n\nWhere no direct Active Directory integration exists, the information system administrator is responsible for establishing new User Names for the relevant application, and setting standard passwords.  It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to reset the standard password to one that only they know.  Assistance with this process can be provided by the information system administrator.\nThe information system administrator is responsible for maintaining User Names for the relevant application under the authorisation of the relevant information asset steward.  Requests for enhanced system privileges must be made to the information asset steward, and will be implemented by the appropriate system administrator(s).\nMulti Factor authentication\nWhere ever possible, and particularly for externally facing systems, multi factor authentication (i.e. a second form of authentication) will be used.\nThe particular MFA method used by a specific information system can be either passive (i.e. a registered signed certificate) or active (i.e. a challenge \u2013 response mechanism) and will be determined by the Information Technology Operations Manager.\nNote that a challenge \u2013 response method is preferred for any external facing information system.\n\n\n\nEquipment Security\n\nLocking the computer\nWhen an employee leaves their desk for any period of time, it is important that they lock the computer (Press and hold the Window \u201cStart\u201d button and then press \u201cL\u201d). This will also occur automatically after 10 minutes of inactivity.\nThis also applies to all non windows devices issued by Wannon Water, including tablets and smartphones.\nShutting down the computer\nWhen an employee leaves their place of work for the day, they must shut down their computer (click Start, then Shutdown, then OK). \nTablet devices and smartphones must be appropriately \u2018screen locked\u2019 when not in use.\nLaptop and tablet security\nLaptops are highly portable.  Do not leave a laptop unattended outside of a Wannon Water location (see the Portable Computer Procedure).\nIf a laptop or tablet device is left unattended in a vehicle the laptop or tablet device must be secured out of plain sight, such as underneath the seats, in the glove compartment etc.  The vehicle must also be securely parked and locked at all times when unattended.\nIf a laptop or tablet device is misplaced or believed stolen it must be reported to the IT team as soon as is practical.  Many devices can be remote located or remote wiped, greatly minimising the potential security impact of any loss.\nSmartphone or Smart Device security\nSmartphones and other smart devices are increasingly powerful tools and are increasingly used as a tool for business.  As a result, a smartphone typically contains potentially valuable business data or access to business data on it, not the least being real time email access.\nWannon Water employees issued a corporate smartphone are encouraged to maintain a high degree of awareness of their smartphone.  As with laptop and tablet devices, a smartphone is a highly desirable asset and must not be left unattended.  Smartphones must be locked at all times when not in use, and should not be connected to unsolicited public WIFI networks.\nWhen left in a vehicle, the smartphone must not be left in public view (i.e. left in the phone cradle) and the vehicle must be locked and secured if left unattended.  This includes brief stops such as in petrol stations.\nIf a smartphone or other smart device is believed lost or stolen the responsible officer must report the loss to the IT team as soon as is practically possible.  As with laptops and tablets, many smartphones or devices can be remotely located and / or wiped, significantly reducing the security risk to Wannon Water.\n\nInformation (Data) Security\nIntellectual Property\nInformation contained within any Wannon Water system is viewed as Wannon Water property. Therefore, any unauthorised copying or transmission of Information may be seen as theft and subject to the Consequences of Employee Misconduct procedure.  See the Intellectual Property Procedure.\n\n\nInformation transfer /extraction\n\nThe transfer of or extraction of any information must be approved by the appropriate information asset steward(s).  This includes the extraction of Wannon Water information or data for third party reporting uses.\n\nThe usage of privately owned data storage devices within Wannon Water systems, to remove data or information from corporate repositories, is prohibited.  \n\n\nOther security issues \nSecurity holes or flaws\nIf employees find a possible security hole or flaw on any Wannon Water computer system or procedure, they are encouraged to immediately report it to the Information Technology team, the Information Security Manager or to their supervisor, either directly or via RiskWare.\n\nViruses\nIf employees transfer a file from a USB Memory Stick to the network (G, H drive), then this file must be scanned by the employee using the anti-virus software installed on their computer.  For assistance, please contact IT.\n\nSystem Patching\nVendors constantly release patches and system upgrades that are designed to mitigate security vulnerabilities.  These patches can range from simple, quick to apply code updates to large, complex version upgrades.\n\nIt is the responsibility of system administrators to ensure the systems they administer are patched to an appropriate security level to minimise cyber risk to Wannon Water. Note that patching of applications will typically fall under the change and configuration management framework currently being rolled out by Wannon Water. \n\nProcedure Breaches\nProcedure breaches will be reported to Wannon Water\u2019s CIO and the Cyber Resilience Working Group and can be subject to Wannon Water's Consequences of Employee Misconduct procedure. Breaches of this procedure will be recorded and managed as security incidents within RiskWare, Wannon Water\u2019s incident management tool.\n\nExclusions\nOn the rare occasions, due to operational support requirements, the Information Technology or Operational Technology team may be required to use a system logged in as another user. \n\nFrom time to time it may also be necessary for a system administrator or information asset steward to login to a discrete system as a system user.  These instances should be kept to a minimum and be used purely for system testing and troubleshooting and never for operational use.\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\nThe CIO is accountable for this procedure.\nThe Information Security Manager is responsible for maintaining this procedure and making employees aware of any changes to it.\nThe Information Technology Operations Manager is responsible for the application of this procedure\n\nAnyone with access to the Wannon Water computer network is responsible for abiding by this procedure.\n\nAs part of the Wannon Water induction program, employees will be required to sign a document, indicating that they have read, understood and will abide by the requirements of this procedure.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nInformation Technology (IT) team \nThe Information Technology team is contactable on extension 6777.\n\n\nSystem administrators\nA system administrator or owner is a Wannon Water officer with responsibility for the management of a particular system.  Such management typically includes day to day system support and operational performance management, and in some cases system upgrades.\n\nTypically system administrators have higher security access levels than operational users to those systems.\n\nA system administrators authority will typically only extend to the discreet application they manage, in some cases however certain systems may be linked, meaning a system administrator may have higher security access to a number of systems, or a number of system administrators may have overlapping access to a set of systems.\n\nTypically an information system administrator will manage an information system holding or processing information assets (i.e. as \u2018infrastructure\u2019).\n\nInformation asset stewards\nAn information asset steward is an officer assigned by the information asset owner to be responsible for managing the information asset on a day to day basis. The Information Steward guides how the information is managed, protected and used on behalf of the owner and defines and enforces rules for the information asset.\n\n\nWannon Water computer network\nThe Wannon Water computer network includes:\nSite Local Area Network, connecting computers and devices within a specific location,\nWide Area Network, connecting Wannon Water sites,\nRemote Access users \u2013 those mobile users connecting to Wannon Water services remotely\nCloud and SAAS services provided for users by Wannon Water.  Examples of these are the RiskWare and Azure platforms currently used by Wannon Water.\nWeb services provided by Wannon Water for end users\nAny other service published by Wannon Water to allow end user access to Wannon Water information assets.\n\nNote that for the purposes of this document the IP based carriage networks used between SCADA devices are deemed to a part of the Wannon Water computer network.  SCADA specific networks such as profibus, BacNet or ModBus connections are however excluded from this definition and deemed to be a part of the SCADA \u2018system\u2019\nUser Names and passwords\nUser Names uniquely identify user principles to information system and enable access to information assets.  \nWannon Water requires user principles to be wherever possible natural persons \u2013 shared or generic usernames are not to be used.  \nThe user principal assigned a username \u2013i.e. the \u2018person\u2019 the username is assigned to \u2013 is accountable for that username and all activity carried out under that username.\nIn the majority of cases, usernames will be generated in Active Directory and imported into other applications.\nPasswords authenticate user principals identified by a User Name against an Information system.  The default authentication method to be used by Wannon Water is a challenge \u2013 response mechanism using a password.  All usernames will have an associated password \u2013 there will be no instances of blank passwords.  All passwords must be kept confidential and adhere to the requirements of the Password Policy  Note that certain access may require the use of a second form of authentication in the form of a token or code as appropriate.\nActive Directory integration\nActive Directory integration refers to an information system drawing User Names and Passwords for an account from Active Directory.  Wherever possible Active Directory integration should be used.  This centralises the creation and administration of User Names and Passwords in Active Directory.\n\nAuthorised Wannon Water equipment and procedures\nAll equipment which has been purchased and installed by the IT Team is classified as \u201cauthorised\u201d. Refer to the computer user\u2019s procedure\n\nAll procedures that are located in SharePoint and are not in a \u2018Draft\u2019 status are classified as \u201cauthorised\u201d.\n\nExternal computer systems\nAny computer system which is not directly connected to the Wannon Water network is classified as \u201cexternal\u201d.  For example, vendors, customers, other water authorities may have a network which is classified as external.\n\nIT Systems\nThis includes the network, applications, data and all other infrastructure, including Wannon Water operated SAAS and cloud platforms.\n\nThird Party \nA Third Party is a non Wannon Water individual, group, organisation or company.  \n\nSome Third Parties are contracted to provide support to various IT systems. Depending on the business criticality of the system that they support, Third Parties will be classified as either Tier 1 suppliers or Tier 2 suppliers.\n\n\nVPDSS\nVPDSS is the Victorian Protective Data Security Standards, a Victorian Government  information security standard published by the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner that Wannon Water and other Victorian Government agencies must comply with.  More details on the VPDSS can be found at https://ovic.vic.gov.au/data-protection/standards/\nACSC Essential 8 \nThe Australian Cyber Security Centre\u2019s essential 8 is a set of 8 baseline cyber security and risk mitigation controls published by the Australian Cyber Security Centre  Australia\u2019s civilian cyber security agency.  Adoption of these controls are highly advised by the VPDSS and are a widely accepted fundamental platform for robust Cyber Security under the recent national cyber security policy .

It also highlights how the fleet is to be used and managed.\nProcedure\nPrerequisites for Permanent Mobile Allocation\nGeneral Allocation Guidelines\nThe following positions will be permanently allocated a mobile phone:\n\nManager\nFull time Operations employees\nAny office-based employee who may be required to regularly undertake duties outside the office environment\n\nThe decision as to whether a particular position requires the allocation of a mobile phone will be made by the manager responsible for the position, providing the prerequisites as outlined above have been met.\n\nSmart Phone (iPhone or equivalent) Allocation\nSmartphones (iPhones) are the default, standard mobile phone to be issued to all employees working in positions listed in section 3.1.1.\n\nResponsibilities of Permanent Mobile Phone Allocation\nPhysical Allocation\nThe mobile phone is the responsibility of the employee to whom it is allocated.\n\nThis employee shall take all reasonable measures to protect the phone from damage, loss, misuse and theft.\nSmart Phone (iPhone)\n\nFor smart phones (iPhones), employees must use the protective case at all times where allocated.  A full protective case will be allocated where the user spends considerable time in an environment potentially hostile to the phone.\n\nThis full protective case will provide the phone with resistance to water infiltration, dust and impact.\n\nUser Guide (as packaged with the phone)\nUpon receipt of a new mobile phone, it is strongly recommended that the employee familiarise themselves with the phone\u2019s features by reading the accompanying user guide.\n\n\n\nTraining\nUpon receipt of a new iPhone, the employee will receive training from an IT team member.\n\nCharging\nCharging the phone should only be done using the charger provided.\n\nShould an employee lose, misplace or damage a charger they must report the loss and organise a replacement via the IT team. All replacement chargers, including vehicle chargers, must be provided by the IT team. Employees are advised to immediately cease using any charger they notice is damaged in any way to prevent possible damage to the phone and any potential injury or hazard.\n\nPreventing Theft\nMobile phones are often the target of theft. Please store the phone securely at all times and, if left in an unattended vehicle, ensure it is hidden from view, with the vehicle locked.\n\nBreakage or Loss of a Mobile Phone\nIf a mobile phone is damaged or lost (including by theft), then the employee is required to inform the IT team, who will place a block on the phone.\n\nFollowing this, the employee must raise an incident in RiskWare using the .   The incident details must include:\n\nInformation about how the phone was lost or broken (i.e., how the protective equipment failed)\nSuggestions to reduce the likelihood of this happening again\n\nTo request a replacement phone, the incident must be submitted to the IT team. The IT team will then organise a replacement phone.\n\nNo replacement phone will be issued without a corresponding RiskWare incident being raised, including the completion of the incident form.\n\nPersonal Use\nWannon Water shall provide employees with a mobile telephone where a business need has been identified for the purpose of carrying out their duties (described in section 3.1.1). \n\nWannon Water considers that reasonable call and SMS costs made whilst employees are undertaking their Wannon Water duties, inclusive of travelling on Wannon Water business, to remain in contact with their immediate family, as acceptable use of the mobile telephone provided to the employee.\n\nWannon Water also acknowledges that making personal calls and sending personal SMS messages are necessary from time to time and directs employees to keep these activities to a minimum. \n\nEmployees are responsible for any personal phone contact numbers stored on their Wannon Water issued mobile phone. In the event of repair or maintenance activity, it is possible that such personal contact numbers may be lost. The IT team shall endeavour to keep such data intact, but it also accepts no responsibility for any losses or corruption.\n\nEmployees are also advised not to store personal data such as, but not limited to, personal photos on the phone.\n\nThe employee may take the phone home.\n\nThe installation and use of apps for personal purposes should be kept to a minimum. The installation and use of apps should take into account the .\n\nBilling\nEach month the following shall happen:\nAn IT Officer shall provide Managers with a detailed breakdown of actual costs incurred by a mobile service during the month where an issue is potentially detected i.e., extraneous charges such as mobile data.\nThe Manager shall then ascertain information from the employee concerned and advise the Branch Manager People and Resilience where an issue that is detected requires resolution under the  procedure.\n\nWannon Water reserves the right to conduct ad hoc audits of all mobile telephone services billed to Wannon Water and generate reports detailing, but not limited to, the following:\n\nCalls made outside of business hours when an employee is not on standby or on call.\nCalls with a duration of longer than five (5) minutes.\nCalls to interstate numbers.\nCalls with a cost exceeding five (5) dollars.\nLarge number of SMS text messages for the period.\nData download costs to the mobile service for the month.\nCharges or fees for any activity not considered reasonable for the operation of the employee\u2019s role. \n\nUse of Mobile Phones in Vehicles\nPrecautionary Principle\n\nThe use of a mobile phone when in control of a vehicle elevates the risk of a serious motor vehicle incident. There are laws that control the use of a mobile phone by a driver. Wannon Water also makes rules above and beyond the law to provide additional safety.\n\nWannon Water urges drivers to comply with the law and rules, and also urges drivers to be cautious and risk aware. \n\nFor further information refer to:     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Road Safety Rules (Law)\n\nThe Victoria law is specified in Section 300 Use of Mobile Phones of the Victorian ,  which is amended with .\n\nA summary of the above section in relation to mobile phone use by a driver of a vehicle is as follows: \nLearner and probationary drivers are not permitted to use a mobile phone at all while driving.\nTexting, email, video calls or such communication are not permitted.\nA driver may make and receive a phone call, perform an audio function, or use the mobile phone as a navigational aid while driving provided the phone is secured in a mounting affixed to the vehicle which is commercially designed, manufactured and installed according to manufacturer instructions. \nA driver may use an un-affixed mobile phone while driving, to make and receive a phone call, perform an audio function, or use the phone as a navigational aid as long as they do not touch the phone in any way (\u201ctouching the phone\u201d includes resting the phone on the driver\u2019s lap).\nA driver is deemed to be \u201cdriving\u201d even when the vehicle is stationary. The driver is deemed to be no longer \u201cdriving\u201d when the vehicle is pulled off the road and parked safely. There are other laws that may be applied by the Police such as dangerous driving laws. \n\n Victoria Police Advice\n\nThe Victoria Police are responsible for administering the Victorian Road Safety Rules. The Victoria Police advises the following on its web site:\n\n\u201cUsing a mobile phone whilst driving distracts your attention from the road and prevents you from maintaining proper control of your vehicle. Due to this, using a hand-held mobile phone whilst driving is illegal and attracts a significant fine and three demerit points.\n\nYou do not need to be talking on the phone to be breaking the law. Whilst driving, it is illegal to:\n\nTalk\nSend or receive text messages\nPlay phone-based games\nTake photos.\n\nIt is also illegal to perform these activities when your vehicle is stopped but not parked, such as when waiting at traffic lights. If your phone rings or you need to send a message while driving, pull over and park safely and legally before answering it.\n\nIt is illegal to use a hands-free phone whilst driving if it causes you to lose proper control of your vehicle. The penalty is a significant fine and demerit points.\n\nAlthough a hands-free device can reduce the physical effort to make and receive calls, it does not necessarily make phone use safer while driving. Consider the following suggestions if you must talk on a hands-free phone whilst driving:\n\nMake sure the hands-free function is set up and working before you start driving.\nKeep conversations short.\nDo not engage in complex or emotional conversations.\nExplain to your caller that you are driving and arrange a better time to speak with them.\nIf it is distracting you from driving, end the call.\u201d\n\nWannon Water\u2019s Position\n\nA driver of a Wannon Water vehicle must comply with relevant road laws in relation to using a mobile phone and comply with the Victoria Police Advice set out above.\n\nIt is recommended that a driver of a Wannon Water vehicle pull over and park the vehicle in a safe location to initiate, receive or engage in a phone call, because this is the safest method to communicate.\n\nWhere a driver has identified and considered the relevant risks and has considered it to be legal and safe to make or receive a phone call when driving, it is recommended that they:\nDial phone numbers through the utilisation of a voice recognition feature (if available).\nAnswer phone calls using the mobile phone\u2019s auto answer feature (if available).\nKeep the conversation short.\n\nVoice Mail\nThe voice mail message function is provided and should be used. A message should be recorded to answer any calls. \n\nThis message should be based on the following scripts.\n\nGeneral voicemail message:\n\u00a0\n\"Hi, you\u2019ve reached [first name, last name]. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.\"\n\nVoicemail when on leave:\n\u00a0\nWhen on leave, update your messages on both your office and mobile phone using this script:\n\n\"Hi, you\u2019ve reached [first name, last name]. I\u2019m on leave until [expected return date]. If you need something sooner, please call [first name, last name]\u00a0on [office OR mobile phone number]. Otherwise, leave a message and I'll get back to you when I return.\"\n\u00a0\n\nUse of Cameras in Mobile Phones\nCameras in mobile phones must only be used to assist with performing the employee\u2019s job. No use of mobile phone cameras outside of this capacity is permitted.\n\nInternet\nAccessing the Internet\nThe mobile phone fleet does have access to the Internet, however this has been enabled to support the employee performing their job, and should be kept to a minimum to avoid excess data charges, and be within the guidelines of  the .\n\nInternet usage may be monitored.\n\nOffensive or Illegal Material\nEmployees are to ensure that no offensive or illegal material is accessed and/or stored on their issued mobile phone.\n\nInformation Storage and Transfer\nAs mentioned, it is permitted that mobile phones can be used to capture and internally transfer business-related images and data.\n\n\n\nInstallation of Mobile Applications or Apps\nThe installation and use of apps is permitted by employees, subject to the following conditions:\n\nUsers are to sign into the App Store with their own individual accounts, not a generic Wannon Water account. The IT Department will set up the iPhone with an Individual Wannon Water Apple ID for use on the phone. This ID will be the employee\u2019s email address and should be kept as the ID for use on the phone. \n\nWannon Water allows users to browse the App Store and choose apps that may be productive for their needs but will not link corporate purchasing to these discrete App Store accounts. \n\nUsers wishing to purchase an app directly rather than via the corporate purchasing system must pay for the app themselves. Any reimbursement for these purchases must be undertaken via the user\u2019s manager through an expense claim. Note any app purchased and deployed by any individual remains the property of Wannon Water regardless of if the cost of the app is reimbursed or not. \n\nWannon Water will monitor and deploy corporate apps to multiple handsets via Wannon Water\u2019s MDM system.\n\nThe IT team reserves the right to remove, block or prevent access to any app deemed inappropriate or in breach of procedure on any Wannon Water owned mobile device.\n\nUse of Email Services\nWhere a smartphone is used to access email, employees are reminded that the requirements of Wannon Water\u2019s  apply.  Employees are reminded to use the email facilities on smartphones for business use only. Email access will be configured via Wannon Water\u2019s MDM platform; employees will not modify, delete or add any other email services to the smartphone.\n\nEmployees are also reminded that a smartphone may cache email data. This means that data may be physically stored on the phone. Any third party accessing the phone may be able to read cached email. To prevent this, users are advised to protect the confidentiality of their PIN codes, and to physically prevent third party access to their handsets.\n\nEmployees may request the IT team for access to their Wannon Water email account on their personal mobile phone. This provision is to assist employees in their daily tasks but is not to encourage employees to work after hours.\n\nManagement of Mobile Phone Fleet\nThe IT team shall be responsible for the management of the Wannon Water\u2019s mobile phone fleet.  As such all training, purchases, replacements, repairs and disposal of mobile phones will be coordinated by the IT team.\n\nDeployment of New Mobile Phones\nThe IT team shall deploy new mobile phones with Wannon Water\u2019s contact number lists installed and will attempt to preserve the existing contact list from the old phone.\n\n\nDisposal of Old Mobile Phones\nMobile phones will be disposed of in accordance with the  procedure and the completion of the relevant section of the Asset Change eForm.  The completed Asset Change eForm will be registered in CM Folder 15/00179.\n\nTransferring Ownership of a Mobile Phone Number\nFor exiting employees, there is an option to have the ownership of their Wannon Water allocated mobile phone number transferred to the employee.  Please consult with the IT team if this is required.\n\nMobile Device Management Platform\nWannon Water deploys a Mobile Device Management (MDM) platform to remotely manage all smart devices, including smart phones. Employees are not to in any way modify any setting or remove any part of this MDM platform, including any software (\u2018App\u2019 or otherwise) deployed onto the mobile phone by the MDM platform.\n\nChoice of Phone Model and Payment Plan /Contract\nThe IT team is responsible for the choice of phone model and payment plan or contract.\n\nInternational Roaming\nNote that international roaming is only available for Branch and General Managers, upon request to the IT Team.  Written approval from their direct manager is required.\n\nInternational Calling\nThe ability to make and receive international calls is disabled as a default. Any requests for this feature to be enabled must be directed to the appropriate General Manager for written approval.\n\nSPAM SMS Messages\nRecently, some employees have received SPAM (unwanted and unrequested) SMS messages on their mobile phones.\n\nThe procedure to adopt in this instance is:\n\nReply to the message with the text STOP\nIf further messages are received, notify the IT Helpdesk on x6777\n\nCyberbullying\nIf employees believe they are being cyberbullied via SMS, they should follow the instructions outlined in the .\n\nIt is important to keep a record of all related SMS messages.

There are also risks which need to be considered.\n\nAt Wannon Water, we would like to encourage employees to experiment safely with two free versions of popular Generative AI tools \u2013 ChatGPT and CoPilot, specifically looking for productivity improvements.  \n\nScope\nThese guidelines are for all Wannon Water employees.\n\nGuidelines\nThis document provides an overview of some of the benefits and risks of these tools and guidance for their safe and effective use.\n\nIt should be read in conjunction with \n\n\n\n\nOpportunities\n\nProductivity\n\nOne of the main benefits of using text based Generative AI tools in the workplace is that they can help companies save time and money. For example, ChatGPT can be used to generate reports, emails, and other documents, which can help employees complete their work more quickly and efficiently. \neg \u201cPlease write a procedure on the safe use of chainsaws\u201d \n\nInformation Retrieval\n\nYou can ask a Generative AI tool for information about a subject (similar to the way you might use the Google search engine).\neg \u201cHow tall is the Eifel Tower\u201d\n\nTranslation\n\nIt can translate from one language into another.\neg \u201cHow do I say thanks in Chinese\u201d\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nA tool can assess whether a text message is positive, negative or neutral.\neg \nText: \"I absolutely loved the movie! The plot was engaging, the characters were well-developed, and the ending was satisfying. Highly recommend!\" Sentiment: Positive\nThis can be used to assess customer survey responses for example.\n\nScripting and coding\n\nMost Generative AI tools can assist developers by providing sample code in popular languages.\n\nSummarisation\n\nTools can summarise sections of text or even whole documents.\n\nRecommendations\n\nYou can ask a tool to provide recommendations on work-related topics such as:\nProblem solving frameworks\nHow to build a positive workplace culture\nTechniques to improve time management\nCreative approaches to problem solving\netc\n\nThere\u2019s much more!  These are just some of the things that these tools can do.  They are trained on such large datasets that they will usually have a response to most requests.\n\nRisks and Limitations\nWhile generative AI tools offer immense benefits, they also pose potential risks to data security, specifically through data loss, resulting in privacy impacts for customers, loss of Intellectual Property and reputational, regulatory, and legal risks for organisations. \n\nData security and privicy considerations\n\nDo not use sensitive or confidential information in your requests.\n\nOnce entered into these tools, the information has been effectively made available to the uncontrolled environment of the internet. \n\nDo not use any information that is owned or related to Wannon Water.\n \nOnly ask general questions. \n\nAlways adhere to Wannon Water\u2019s data security and privacy procedures.\n\n\nLimitations\n\nResponses from Generative AI tools may also be limited as follows:\n\nData inaccuracy and biases\n\nGenerative AI models learn from the data they are trained on. If the data contains inaccuracies or biases, the model will learn and reproduce those inaccuracies or biases in its generated outputs. This can lead to the generation of misleading or incorrect information.  \n\nLack of emotional intelligence \n\nA Generative AI tool may misinterpret the emotional context of user input, leading to inappropriate or insensitive responses. They may also provide generic responses that do not resonate with users on an emotional level.\n  \nLimits on ability to reason\n\nReasoning helps in dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty. Without the ability to reason, generative AI tools may struggle when faced with ambiguous input or situations. This limitation can lead to inaccurate, contextually inappropriate, or nonsensical outputs, especially in real-world scenarios where information may be incomplete or ambiguous.\n\nMitigations\n\nTo address these limitations, check that the content produced has been fact checked and is accurate, current, appropriate, and sensitive.  \n\nAlso, check that the content produced is in line with relevant procedures, policies, legislation and regulations.\n\nIt is also important to acknowledge the use of Generative AI within the creation of your content and in any resulting decision making.  Generative AI can assist in making decisions \u2013 you remain the decision maker.\n\n\nEffective Usage Guidelines\n\u201cPrompting\u201d is a valuable skill in using Generative AI. It involves crafting questions or statements (prompts) in a way that guides the tool to produce desired outputs more effectively. This skill is crucial because the quality of the prompt will significantly influence the tool's response.  \n\nTo use a Generative AI tool effectively, please consider the following usage guidelines:\n\nBe clear and specific and use normal language.\n\nProvide clear and specific instructions to get more accurate and relevant responses.  \n\nPrompt in different ways.  \n\nIf the initial response is not what you are looking for, consider providing more context or rephrasing your prompt for better results.\nIf you dislike the response format, demonstrate the format you\u2019d like to see. \n\nSplit complex requests into several simpler requests.\n\nYou can have a \u201cconversation\u201d with a Generative AI tool, which comprises several sequential requests that are sometimes needed to get to an answer.  \n\neg \nRequest 1: \u201chow does ChatGPT work?\u201d\nResponse 1: <<something too technical for your needs>> \nRequest 2: \u201cplease explain this as if I were 12 years old and limit the response to 5 lines\u201d  \nResponse 2: <<something easier to understand>>\n\nPermitted tools\nWannon Water employees are currently permitted to use ChatGPT and Microsoft's CoPilot.\n\nUsing ChatGPT\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that is accessible to the general public.\n\nIt can be accessed at: \n\nYou will then be prompted to create a login user account. Please use your Wannon Water email address for this.\n\nOnce you have signed on, you will see a page that looks like this:\n\n\n\nUsing CoPilot \nMicrosoft's CoPilot is a new generative AI tool that is now available for free on the Edge browser on your PC.   This version is called CoPilot with Bing Chat.\n\n\n\nFrom here CoPilot can be used in a similar way to ChatGPT - generate text, answer questions, etc. \n\n\nCoPilot will soon be available within the Microsoft Office suite of products (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Teams, SharePoint etc). When deployed at Wannon Water, you will be able to use CoPilot to perform other tasks that you currently do manually, such as document writing, email and report summarisation, minute taking in Teams and presentation generation.\n\nFurther information on this will be provided to employees in due course.\n\nNext Steps\n\nPlease experiment safely with ChatGPT and CoPilot\n\nA survey will be circulated to understand how you have been using these tools, and asking if you would like to participate in a Community of Interest which could help to drive the broader use of Generative AI in Wannon Water.\n\nAssistance\nAll enquiries for assistance with the use of these tools should be directed through the Wannon Water IT Helpdesk.\n\nOnline resources\n\n\n\n\nRoles and responsibilities\nDefinitions \n\nGovernance\n\nDocument version history\n\n\n\n\n", "Use of text based Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).DOCX"], ["Purpose\nThis procedure documents Wannon Water\u2019s standard requirements for response to an Alarm triggered by the Vehicle Safety System (VSS), also referred to as the Smartrak System.\nScope\nThis procedure applies to:\nVehicle Safety System Manager.\nVehicle Safety System Alarm Security Monitoring Centre (SMC) provider.\nAll employees and/or contractors using a Wannon Water vehicle with VSS installed.\nProcedure \nThe VSS will generate alarms when these specific events occur.\nVehicle Impact\nVehicle Rollover\nPendant Duress Button Activation\nDash Duress Button Activation\nThe alarms will be configured to automatically send alerts via several methods:\nEmail alert to pre-configured addresses.\nSMS alert to pre-configured mobile phone numbers.\nThe Smartrak application will alert all logged-in users via an audio alert and visual notification.\nIntegration to alarm SMC software.\nAlarm Monitoring and Response\nAlarms will be transmitted electronically to the SMC.

By using the vehicle, the driver and passenger consent to Wannon Water collecting and storing vehicle location information.\nIndividuals have the right to ensure any personal information that is captured by Wannon Water is accurate and securely stored in accordance with the Information Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014. Any request for access to Vehicle Safety System data is to be directed to the Vehicle Safety System Manager as described in Clause 4.\nEmployees will be informed of Vehicle Safety System during commissioning of the system and for new employees, during their induction process.\nVehicle Booking System\nThe Vehicle Safety System includes the system for booking of pool vehicles.  The system is accessed via the web link on the Watershed Intranet Page.  The instructions for booking vehicles are provided on the \u201cBooking Vehicles\u201d page of Watershed and the Vehicle Booking Procedure (to be updated).  Specific instruction is available from the Corporate Services Fleet & Facilities Coordinator.\nFob (iButton)\nEach employee will be issued with a driver Identification tag known as a \u201cFob\u201d.  The manufacturer name of the Fob is \u201ciButton\u201d.  This Fob is to be \u201cattached\u201d on at the commencement of each use of the vehicle by placing the tag next to the dash receiver.  \nRecording the driver identification fob improves the level of safety provided by the system through ensuring that an employee may be telephoned directly in the event of a working alone Duress Alarm.\nIf the vehicle has been booked using the Fleet Booking System, the driver identification will be assigned during the booking process.  This driver\u2019s information may be updated by \u201ctapping on\u201d using another Fob should the individual driving a vehicle change during use of the vehicle.\nIt is the responsibility of all Wannon Water employees to \u201ctap on\u201d with their Fob at the commencement of each use of a vehicle by placing the tag next to the dash receiver. If any employee does not \u201ctap on\u201d to the vehicle, and the vehicle has not been booked using the Fleet Booking System, the system will by default apply to the next journey, the driver identification details recorded from the last active user in that vehicle.\nAlarms\nThe Vehicle Safety System will generate alarms when specific events occur.  Alarms are event-based and configurable according to business requirements. The Project Plan and Business Case have specified the following priority alarm types:\nVehicle Crash Alarm\nVehicle Rollover Alarm\nPendant Duress Button Alarm Activation\nDash Duress Button Alarm Activation\nAn Alarm can be triggered in three ways, being:\nAutomatically, if the vehicle is involved in a collision which triggers the inbuilt sensors.\nManually by the driver by pressing the dash mounted duress button.\nManually by an employee by pressing the portable duress pendant button (which works up to a maximum of 700m away from the vehicle).\nOnce triggered, an Alarm will be transmitted electronically.  The information will have: \nThe name of the driver registered in booking system \nThe mobile phone number registered in the system for that driver\nThe most recent GPS location coordinates of the vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure to be given to SMC (Security Monitoring Center)\nUpon the receipt of an alarm, the SMC will:\n1.\tMake a single call to the vehicle driver\u2019s mobile phone number within the Australian Standards of an alarm being received (1 minute). \n2.\tIf contact is established with the driver, the SMC will take action according to the information they receive. Where an emergency service is requested, the SMC will call Triple Zero (000) within one (1) minute, nominating the requested emergency service provider; and relay all Information to that emergency service provider.  \n3.\tIf there is no answer from the driver within 5 minutes of the alarm being received, SMC will call Triple Zero (000) and nominate Victoria Police as the first responder and relay all Information to that emergency service provider.\nAlarm Types\nThe technical specifications for each alarm type are configurable in the system by the Vehicle Safety System Manager according to vendor instructions.\nVehicle Crash Alarm means the Vehicle Safety System has detected a rapid deceleration of the vehicle in space and time during a given journey. \nVehicle Rollover Alarm means the Vehicle Safety System has detected the orientation of the vehicle in relation to horizontal plain has changed beyond a pre-configured angle during a given journey. \nPendant Duress Alarm means the portable duress alarm device has been triggered manually by a user for assistance.\nDash Duress Alarm means the vehicle\u2019s dash-mounted duress alarm device has been triggered manually by a user for assistance.\nThe detailed procedure for Alarms monitoring and response is contained in the document \u201cVehicle Safety System Alarm Procedure\u201d.\nSatellite Capabilities\nThe default configuration of the system includes a Telstra 3G/NextG compatible wireless modem with antenna (internal or external depending on vehicle type).  This configuration should give effective coverage for most vehicle trips and work locations.\nWhere no Telstra 3G/NextG coverage exists, the GPS device in the vehicle will continue to record time stamped GPS location data which will upload when the vehicle returns to 3G/NextG coverage, however the Alarm will not be able to be sent to the SMC.\nThe system generates a report that details \u201cblackspots\u201d where vehicles have travelled and 3G/NextG coverage is not available.  Existing vehicle systems can be upgraded for Satellite (Iridium) capabilities where regular work occurs in a \u201cblackspot\u201d area subject to a Business Case application.  \nThere are significant additional costs, both capital and ongoing for satellite systems and as such any Business Case proposed for this upgrade is to be approved by the Vehicle Safety System Manager and relevant General Manager.\nAccess to System Information\nAll Vehicle Safety System data will be retained for a minimum of 2 years after administrative use of the records has concluded in accordance with Class 06.09.02 of the Public Record Office Standard 07/01 General Retention and Disposal Authority of Common Administrative Records.\nRequests for access to information from the Vehicle Safety System must be directed to the Vehicle Safety System Manager or a person approved by the Vehicle Safety System Manager. \nAll access to recorded Vehicle Safety System data for incident investigation will be logged.

This access is for business purposes only, and the access must be approved by the Vehicle Safety System Manager.\nAccess historical information to confirm locational and time of operational past activities such as attendance to site, attendance to customer residence and similar. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup of Alarms\nThe specific software configuration of the Alarm system will be the responsibility of the Vehicle Safety System Manager.  The specific software configuration procedure will be available as per the vendor specific documentation. \n\nThe Vehicle Safety System Manager is responsible for maintaining this Procedure and ensuring any changes to alarm monitoring services and system administration are reflected in timely revisions to this Procedure and are communicated to the designated SMC provider and all corporate vehicle/system users.\nSetting Up and Managing Geo-fences\nGeo-fencing is a feature of the Vehicle Safety System.  Using the software user interface, a geographically bounded area can be defined, and rules applied to this defined area.  A Geo-fence is a type of virtual barrier and when a fleet vehicle crosses the barrier an alert or action can be programmed. Business functions can be automated so when a vehicle location triggers a Geo-fence, an alert is sent, or reports generated. Geo-fences are used strictly for business purposes only. Geo-fences can only be setup by the Vehicle Safety System Manager, or authorised Users given approval. When setting up a new Geo-fence, or modifying an existing Geo-fence, the details will be entered into the Geo-fence Register held in the system software and maintained by the Vehicle Safety System Manager.  \nPrivate Vehicle Use and Privacy of Information\nSome employees may have special provisions within their employment agreements with Wannon Water that permit private vehicle use during certain periods.\nAs the Vehicle Safety System cannot be deactivated, employees should note that access to information can only be for authorised business purposes only and these purposes are detailed in this Procedure.  Specific concerns can be discussed with the Vehicle Safety System Manager.  Access to historical locational information for periods when the vehicle is subject to private use requires the written consent of the Privacy Officer. \nRelease of Information Externally\nAll data and their contents are the copyrighted property of Wannon Water and shall not be copied, distributed or used without the written approval of the Vehicle Safety System Manager and Privacy Officer.  All requests for release of Vehicle Safety System data externally must include a written request to the Vehicle Safety System Manager.  \nSystem Maintenance\nVehicle Log Bookkeeping\nThe Vehicle Safety System provides an electronic odometer feature.  Wannon Water will run a trial using the existing logbook method, and the electronic method with the intention of replacing manual-entry logbooks with electronic logbooks during 2015.\nScheduling Checks and Testing of System Functionality\nReporting on the current operational status and performance of the Vehicle Safety System is the responsibility of the Vehicle Safety System Manager. \nThe SmartTrack system includes automatic system health reporting and will automatically flag faulty hardware and bring this to the GPS Vehicle Safety System Manager\u2019s attention via a report.\nIf an employee becomes aware that some function of the Vehicle Safety System is not operational; the Vehicle Safety System Manager must be notified.\nVehicle Maintenance and Servicing Management\nThe Vehicle Safety System Manager is responsible for the maintenance of all the Vehicle Safety System equipment.  \nThis responsibility includes ensuring that Vehicle Safety System is operating normally at all times. Regular service inspections of the devices will ensure that they are operational with any identified faults logged and reported to the Vehicle Safety System Manager.\nThe Vehicle Safety System provides a mechanism for assisting with vehicle maintenance activities.\nThe Vehicle Safety System Manager is responsible for the administration and operation of the maintenance and servicing management function.  \nThe Vehicle Safety System provides functionality to configure different kinds of servicing options (Oil Replacement, Tyre Rotation etc.) and can be programmed to receive alerts when these items need attention.

With the increased use of newer \ntechnologies, efficiency gains are available through more equitable call back arrangements.  \n \nThree distinct types of Call Back/Call Out have been recognised:  \n \n25.1 Type A: Responding to a Phone  Call \n \nDefinition Type A : Where an employee is not required to leave the location from where they have \nanswered a call to respond to the call. For example, an employee receives a phone call (from an \nalarm  or customer) and is required to make another telephone call or access the computer system  \n \nvia a modem or broadband connection to properly respond to the initial call . \n \nFor a response to a Type A call back, an employee shall be paid a minimum of half (\u00bd) an hour work \nat appropriate overtime rates.  \n \nThe minimum payment period shall not apply when the overtime is continuous with the completion or \ncommencement of ordinary working hours, or with other planned or unplanned overtime, or occurs \nwithin the span of  hours under this agreement. The employee shall not be entitled to payment more \nthan once for the specified minimum period of time.  \n \n25.2 Type B: Call Back for Employees on  Standby  \n \nDefinition Type B: Where an employee has been  required to be on standby or available ( and will  be \nreceiving standby, or availability allowance) and receives a phone call and is subsequently required to \nleave the location from where they have answered the call to commence work. For example, an \nemployee on standby is called  in to attend to a sewer blockage.  \n \nAn External Operational/Maintenance Services Employee who is called to respond to a call back as \ndefined as Type B, shall be paid a minimum of three (3) hours of work at appropriate overtime rates.  \n \nIf the call out for an External Operational/Maintenance Services employee occurs between the hours \nof 10.00pm and 6.00am on any day, the employee shall be paid a minimum of three (3) hours of work \nat the appropriate overtime rates.  \n\nWannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020  \n \n20  \n \n \nAn Administrative/Technical/Professional Emplo yee who is called to respond to a call back as defined \nas Type B, shall be paid a minimum of one (1) hour of work at appropriate overtime rates.  \n \nThe minimum payment period shall not apply when the overtime is continuous with the completion or \ncommencement  of ordinary working hours, or with other planned or unplanned overtime, or occurs \nwithin the span of hours under this agreement. The employee shall not be entitled to payment more \nthan once for the specified minimum period of time.  \n \n25.3 Type C: Call back  for employees not on  standby  \n \nDefinition Type C: Where an employee has not been required to be on standby or available  (and \nwill not be receiving standby or availability allowance), and receives a phone call and is requested  to \nleave the location from where they have answered the  call to commence work. For example , due to \nthe nature of an after-hours incident additional staff are required and are request ed to assist from \nan authori sed employee not on standby.  \n \nAn External Operational/Maintenance Services Employee, who is called to respond to a call back as \ndefined as Type C, shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours of work at appropriate overtime rates.  \n \nAn Administrative/Technical/Professional Employee who is called to respond to a call back as defined \nas Type C, shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hour of work at appropriate overtime rates.  \n \nThis Clause shall apply only in the event of employees additional to standby personnel being required \nto attend an after -hours incident. It shall not apply where an employee on standby requests a second \nemployee on standby to respond on their behalf due to the location of the worksite and the second \nemployee agrees. The agreement between employees may be a verbal standing a greement.  \n \nThe minimum payment period shall not apply when the overtime is continuous with the completion or \ncommencement of ordinary working hours, or with other planned or unplanned overtime, or occurs \nwithin the span of hours under this agreement. The e mployee shall not be entitled to payment more \nthan once for the specified minimum period of time.  \n \n25.4 Travel  Time  \n \nFor the purposes of this Clause, time reasonably spent in travelling shall be counted as time worked.  \n \n   Safety  Break  \n \nOn any one ordinary workday, employees must delay their start time or bring forward their finishing \ntime (without loss of pay) as per the calculations in the Table below if they have responded to Type A, \nType B or Type C Call Outs (as defined in above Clause 25), or if they h ave undertaken overtime.  \n \nAgreement must be received from the employees Manager/Coordinator for an employee to bring \nforward their finishing time in lieu of delaying start time.  \n \nStart of Call Out or  \nOvertime  End of Call Out or  \nOvertime  Allow able Start Time Delay or Earlier \nFinishing Time  \non Ordinary Workday  \n(see Note below)  Time on \nPreceding  \nDay Time on \nDay Time on \nPreceding  \nDay Time on \nDay \nEnd of  \nordinary \nhours   Before \n10:00 pm   No delay in starting time or bringing \nforward finishing time.  \nAfter \n10:00 pm    Before \n5:00am  A delay to starting time must occur by the \nnumber of hours worked.  \n\nWannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020  \n \n21  \n \n \n \nAfter \n10:00pm    At or \nbeyond the \nstart of \nordinary \nhours  If work continues past the start of \nordinary hours, a break must be taken  as \nsoon as practicable by the number of \nhours worked. Any time worked after the \nstart of ordinary hours is part of the normal \nhours . \n  \n \nAfter \n5:00am    \nBefore the \nstart of \nordinary \nhours  Either (with agreement from the \nemployees Manager/Coordinator):  \n \n1. Be paid overtime for that period,  or \n2. Bring forward their finishing time by \nthe   equivalent  amount  of time \n \nNotes:  \nDelay of no more than one ordinary day hours is allowable (i.e. allowable delays do not carry over \nto the next ordinary  day).  \n \nBy agreement, this clause may be varied  to meet operational or individual need based on safety \nrequirements.  \n \n26.1 Requirement for Safety Break for Other  Reasons  \n \nOver and above the allowable delays in starting time on ordinary days, any employee may elect not to \ncommence duties, or relieve the mselves from duties, if they believe there is a safety risk to \nthemselves or others due to fatigue.  \n \nAn employee shall notify their Manager/Coordinator at the earliest opportunity of any such absence, \nand provide details of the activities that have caused the fatigue.

Applicati ons for special leave under this clause must be pre -approved by the Managing \nDirector or their delegate.  \n \nFor the approved time employees spend undertaking a voluntary emergency management activity under \nthis clause, access to the conditions of the Safety Break relating to Allowable Start Time Delay or Earlier \nFinishing Time may need to be considered.  \n \n   Dispute  Resolution  \n \n56.1 Disputes Settling  Procedure  \n \n    Resolution of Disputes and Grievances  \n \nUnless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, a dispute or grievance about a matter arising under \nthis Agreement or the National Employment Standards, other than termination of employment, must \nbe dealt with in accordance with this clause. This includes a dispute or grievance about whether an \nemployer had reaso nable grounds to refuse a request for flexible working conditions or an application \nto extend unpaid parental leave.  \n \nThis clause does not apply to any dispute on a matter or matters arising in the course of bargaining in \nrelation to a proposed workplace a greement.  \n \nThe employer or an employee covered by this agreement may choose to be represented at any stage \nby a representative, including a union representative or employer\u2019s organisation.  \n \n    Obligations  \n \nThe parties to the dispute or grievance, and the ir representatives, must genuinely attempt to resolve \nthe dispute or grievance through the processes set out in this clause and must cooperate to ensure \nthat these processes are carried out expeditiously.  \n \nWhilst a dispute or grievance is being dealt with in accordance with this clause, work must continue in \naccordance with usual practice, provided that this does not apply to an employee who has a \n\nWannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020  \n \n49  \n \nreasonable concern about an imminent risk to the employee\u2019s  health or safety, has advised the \nemployer of this concern and has not unreasonably failed to comply with a direction by the employer \nto perform other available work that is safe and appropriate for the Employee to perform.  \n \nNo person covered by the agreement will be prejudiced as to the final settlement of the dispute or \ngrievance by the continuance of work in accordance with this clause.  \n \n    Agreement  and Dispute  Settlement  Facilitation  \n \nFor the purposes of compliance with this Agreement (including compliance with this dispute settlement \nprocedure) where the chosen employee representative is another employee of the employer, the \nemployee  must be released by the employee\u2019s  employer from nor mal duties for such periods of time \nas may be reasonably necessary to enable the employee  to represent employees concerning matters \npertaining to the employment relationship including but not limited to:  \n\u2022 Investigating  the circumstances  of a dispute  or an alleged  breach  of this Agreement  or the \nNational Employment  Standards;  \n\u2022 Endeavoring to resolve a dispute arising out of the operation of the agreement  or the \nNational Employment Standards; or  \n\u2022 Participating in conciliation, arbitration or any other agreed alt ernative dispute \nresolution process.  \n \nThe release from normal duties referred to in this clause is subject to the proviso that it does not \nunduly affect the operations of the employer.  \n \n    Discussion  of Grievance  or Dispute  \n \nThe dispute or grievance must  first be discussed by the aggrieved employee(s) with the immediate \nsupervisor of the employee(s).  \n \nIf the matter is not settled, the employee(s) can require that the matter be discussed with another \nrepresentative of the employer appointed for the purpose s of this procedure.  \n \n    Internal  Process  \n \nIf any party to the dispute or grievance who is covered by the agreement refers the dispute or \ngrievance to an established internal dispute or grievance resolution process, the matter must first be \ndealt with in  accordance with that process, provided that the process is conducted in a timely manner \nand it is consistent with the following principles:  \n\u2022 The rules of natural  justice;  \n\u2022 Provide for mediation or conciliation of the  grievance;  \n\u2022 Provide that the employers will take into consideration any views on who should  conduct \nthe review;  and \n\u2022 Be conducted as quickly, and with as little formality, as a proper consideration of  the \nmatter  allows.  \n \nIf the dispute or grievance is not settled through an internal dispute or grievance resolution process, \nthe matter can be dealt with in accordance with the processes set out below.  \n \nIf the matter is not settled, either party may refer the matter to Fair Work Commission (FWC).  \n \n    Disputes  of a Collective  Character  \n \nThe parties  covered by the agreement acknowledge that disputes of a collective character concerning  more \nthan one employee may be dealt with more expeditiously by an early reference to FWC.  \n \nNo dispute of a collective character may be referred to FWC directly unless there has been a genuine \nattempt to resolve the dispute at the workplace level prior to it being referred to FWC for conciliation.  \n \n    Conciliation  \n \n\nWannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020  \n \n50  \n \nWhere a dispute or grievance is referred, a member of FWC shall do everything that appears to the \nmember to be right and proper to assist the parties to the dispute to agree on terms for the settlement \nof the dispute or grievance.  \n \nThis may include arranging:  \n\u2022 conferences  of the parties  to the dispute  or their representatives  presided  over by the \nmember;  and \n\u2022 for the parties to the dispute or their representatives to confer  among themselves \nat conferences at which the member is not  present.  \n \nConciliation before FWC shall be regarded as completed when:  \n\u2022 the parties to the dispute have reached agreement on the settlement of the \ngrievance or dispute;  or \n\u2022 the member of FWC conducting the conciliation has, either of their own motion  or after an \napplication by either party, satisfied themselves that there is no likelihood that within a \nreasonable period, further conc iliation will result in a settlement;  or \n\u2022 the parties to the dispute have informed the FWC member that there is no likelihood of \nagreement  on the settlement  of the grievance  or dispute  and the member  does  not have \nsubstantial reason to refuse to regard the conciliation proceedings as  completed.  \n \n    Arbitration  \n \nIf the dispute or grievance has not been settled when conciliation has been completed, either party \nmay request that FWC proceed to determine the dispute or grievance by arbitration.  \n \nWhere a member  of FWC has exercised conciliation powers in relation to the dispute or grievance, \nthe member shall not exercise, or take part in the exercise of, arbitration powers in relation to the \ndispute or grievance if a party objects to the member doing so.  \n \nSubject to sub -clause 56.1.9 below, the determination of FWC is binding upon the persons covered by \nthis agreement.  \n \nAn appeal lies to a Full Bench of FWC, with the leave of the Full Bench, against a determination of a \nsingle member of FWC made pursuant to  this clause.  \n \n    Conduct  of Matters  before  FWC  \n \nSubject to any agreement between the parties to the dispute in relation to a particular dispute or \ngrievance and the provisions of this clause, in dealing with a dispute or grievance through conciliation \nor arbitration, FWC may conduct the matter in accordance with Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part 5 -1 \nof the Fair Work Act 2009.  \n\nWannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020  \n \n51  \n \n \n \n \n\nSCHEDULE A: RATES OF PAY - WANNON WATER ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT
