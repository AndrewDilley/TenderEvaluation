[["Purpose\nWannon Water is committed to continuously improving Zero Harm outcomes including Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) and Wellbeing. This extends to minimising all hazards and risks associated with the adverse effects of alcohol and drug use. The purpose of this procedure is to provide employees, contractors and visitors with the responsibilities, tolerances and direction regarding the purchase, storage and consumption of alcohol and drugs in the workplace.\nScope\nThis procedure applies to all employees, contractors, contractor\u2019s employees, and visitors of Wannon Water, while on Wannon Water sites or performing work on or behalf of the Corporation.   The collective term used in this procedure for these defined groups will be individuals unless otherwise stated. \nProcedure \nResponsibilities\nThe OHS Act requires employees to take reasonable care for their own health and safety in the workplace, and the health and safety of others who may be affected by their acts or omissions. This includes ensuring they are not, as a result of alcohol or other drugs, affected in a way that may put themselves, others, or the organisation at risk.\n\nWannon Water considers any blood alcohol concentration can cause impairment and may affect an individual\u2019s ability to work, behave and make decisions safely.\n \nAll individuals on a Wannon Water site or performing work for Wannon Water during the hours of 6am - 6pm Monday to Friday inclusive, or on call or standby (rostered), or for those activities that require a legal 0.0 blood alcohol concentration, must not have in their system any alcohol, or illegal drugs, prescription, or over the counter medication not approved by Wannon Water (as per 3.1.4 and 3.5.2).\n\nIn the case of any prescription medications or over the counter drugs, all individuals who may be taking these are required to inform Wannon Water via their manager of any potential effects that has the potential to reduce their capacity to undertake the inherent requirements of their role, behave, or make decisions safely.\n\nNOTE: Some medications, whether over the counter or prescribed, contain warnings about driving and or operating machinery.  Wannon Water requires employees who are taking any medication that may compromise performance and/or safety to advise their manager of the existence of such warnings prior to starting work.\u201d  Note that it is not necessary for the employee to disclose the illness for which they are taking medication.  The employee may be required to provide some means of verification (such as a medical certificate) as to the side effects of the medication if the medication is to be taken over an extended period of time.  The medical practitioner may need to be provided with a list of the employee\u2019s tasks so an informed assessment can be made.\n\nThe manager will take into account any effects of the medication when assigning the employee\u2019s tasks in consultation with People & Wellbeing.\n\nAll individuals are required to immediately report any person on Wannon Water site or performing work on or behalf of Wannon Water who they consider may be impaired by alcohol or drug use and are deemed at risk of jeopardizing the safety of themselves or others.\n\nAll employees and managers are empowered to stop any individual from working or entering a Wannon Water site if they have reasonable cause to believe the worker is impaired.\n \nAny alcohol or drug related incidents must be formally lodged on the IMS system.\n\nContractors / Visitors\n\nContractors and their employees working on Wannon Water sites have the same obligations as an employee of Wannon Water.\n\nWhere a contractor\u2019s employee is reasonably suspected of being impaired whether due to alcohol or drugs, the Wannon Water employee responsible for the contractor (Contractor Manager) will require the contractor to remove the offending person from the site. The contractor shall bear any costs associated with the removal and any cessation of work that results from the removal. The Contract Manager (or Superintendent if there is one) shall consider the safety of that person and their ability to arrange suitable transport to a safe location and may consider suspending the works until the situation is made safe.\n\nWhen a visitor to a Wannon Water site is deemed to be affected by alcohol or other drugs, they are to be directed to leave the site.  Wannon Water shall consider the safety of the visitor and their ability to arrange suitable transport to a safe location.  The relevant manager shall be informed of the incident and any further action that may be required.\n\nReasonable Suspicion of Impairment\nEmployees\nWhere an employee is identified as possibly being affected by alcohol or other drugs, it must be reported to a manager immediately.  The individual must be directed to stop whatever they are doing or denied entry to site. The manager should contact the Executive People & Resilience or Senior Manager People & Wellbeing immediately for further instruction. \n\nThe employee will be provided the opportunity to demonstrate that they are not impaired by alcohol or drugs. If Wannon Water considers that the employee\u2019s ability to work in a safe manner is compromised, then arrangements will be made for the employee to immediately stop work, undertake impairment testing and be taken home safely at Wannon Water\u2019s expense. (arrangements may also need to be made for the storage/return of the employee\u2019s vehicle).\n\nImpairment Testing\nImpairment testing, also referred to as fitness for work or fitness for duty testing systems, measures actual impairment (rather than the presence of alcohol and/ or drugs or drug by-products in the system). Tests vary and can include testing reaction times on a computer and eye reaction to light. Impairment testing may be in conjunction with, alcohol and other drug testing at the workplace. Where a drug or alcohol test is requiring that the employee is escorted to the Emergency Department of the nearest Public Health facility for the purpose of a blood test or other recommended testing to be undertaken.\nWhere an employee is found to be in breach of this procedure, it will be considered a serious violation and employee misconduct. Appropriate action will be taken as per the Consequences of Employee Misconduct Procedure. The Executive People & Resilience together with senior management will make this judgment. Wannon Water has a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d approach to employees affected by alcohol or drugs in the workplace, and any incident may result in termination\nIf an employee refuses to participate in the alcohol and/or drug test, this will be assumed as the employee being impaired and action will commence accordingly consistent with Wannon Water\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d approach. \n\nLoss of Drivers Licence\nWhere an employee licence is suspended the employee must notify Wannon Water. In the event of an employee losing their licence, continuation of employment will be assessed based on whether the loss of licence prevents the worker from carrying out the inherent requirements of the job. The appropriate General Manager in conjunction with the Executive People & Resilience will undertake the assessment.\n\nConsumption, Distribution and Storage of Drugs and Alcohol on Wannon Water Premises\nNo individual shall unlawfully possess, use, sell or distribute illicit drugs whilst engaged in Wannon Water business or on Wannon Water premises. Failure to comply with this clause will result in action taken under the Consequences of Employee Misconduct Procedure for employees and the incident will be reported to Police.\nThe consumption of alcohol on property owned, leased or occupied by Wannon Water is prohibited, unless authorised by the Managing Director. Any authorised functions shall be monitored with the view of the responsible consumption of alcohol e.g. limited provision of alcohol and the provision of non-alcoholic drinks.\nThe purchase of alcohol by Wannon Water must be authorised by the Managing Director. Other than transient storage (Clause 8.4 below) the storage of alcohol on Wannon Water premises will only be permissible for the purpose of Managing Director approved functions and alcohol storage shall be separate to the storage of milk and other daily food or beverage consumables.\nShort term (less than 2 days) transient storage of low quantities of alcohol by employees is permitted for the purposes supporting employees undertake shopping activities during the work day and/or transfers to and from home.\n\n\nInformation, Education and Training\nAll employees will be provided with a copy of this procedure (new employees at the time of their Induction). \n\nAll employees will be provided access to information on alcohol and drugs and their effects - including details of such things as community services and programs offering assistance.\n\nManagers may be required to participate in training programs provided to further understand how to identify employees affected by alcohol or other drugs, how to manage associated risk, and their specific responsibilities under the alcohol and other drugs policy.\n\nRehabilitation and Employee Assistance Program (EAP)\nWannon Water acknowledges that some employees will experience problems as a result of their own or others alcohol or drug use.  While this use will not be accepted as an excuse for poor performance or inappropriate behaviour, alcohol and drug related problems will be addressed in a supportive and constructive way for those willing to deal with their problems and working to overcome them.  \n\nEmployees who identify as having an alcohol and/or other drugs problem referred to professional assistance, which might include Wannon Water\u2019s EAP. Employees can also choose to access the service of their own accord. EAPs provide a confidential service to assist employees to resolve personal issues which may affect their work performance and can add to the effectiveness of a workplace alcohol and other drugs policy. Further information on Wannon Water\u2019s Employee Assistance Program can be located on Watershed.\nDefinitions \nGovernance\n\nDocument version history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Alcohol and Drugs in the Workplace Procedure.DOCX"], ["PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure employees are aware of behaviour that could amount to misconduct and that all relevant parties are aware of Wannon Water's policy for dealing with misconduct. \n\nPOLICY\nWannon Water expects employees to observe acceptable standards of behaviour.\nEmployees must not engage in behaviour that amounts to misconduct (including serious misconduct) at the workplace. This includes where employees are working on site or off-site, attending a work-related conference or function, or attending a client or other work-related event, including retreats and social events.\n\nFailure to follow these rules may result in disciplinary action ranging from counselling, training, a written warning or termination, depending on the severity of the offence.\n\nSCOPE\nThis disciplinary procedure applies to all employees.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS \nNIL.\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\nManagers\nManagers are responsible for:\nidentifying and addressing situations of employee misconduct and trying to informally resolve them in the first instance, where appropriate. in consultation with People & Wellbeing\nallegations or instances of misconduct are reported to People & Wellbeing in a timely manner\nProvide support and information to any investigation process.\n\nPeople and Wellbeing\nAre responsible for:\nEnsuring employees are provided procedural fairness in investigation processes\nConfidentiality is maintained to the extent possible\nThe processes in this procedure are followed\n\nEmployees\nAre responsible to:\ncomply with this policy and related procedures; and\nreport any instances or allegations of misconduct to the relevant manager, or People & Wellbeing  as appropriate\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\nExamples of breaches of conduct and behaviour\nThe following is a list of conduct and behaviours, incidents or events that may result in disciplinary action, but it should not be considered all-inclusive.  Management has the discretion to review this list or its interpretation.\n\nRemoving or misplacing company property or equipment, customer information, or Wannon Water documentation without prior approval.  This includes transferring, forwarding, removing or copying intellectual property.\n\nViolation of Wannon Water policies or procedures.\n\nActions or behaviours as an employee or private citizen that result in criminal charges.\n\nAny action that puts in jeopardy the health and/or safety of any employee or member of the public.\n\nAny actions or behaviours that constitute bullying or harassment.\n\nWilful destruction or damaging of any Wannon Water property.\n\nFailure to follow directions, work requests, rules and responsibilities as required by management or the Employee\u2019s immediate supervisor.\n\nAny breach of confidentiality relating to employees or Wannon Water business.\n\nUnauthorised comment in the media.\n\nConsistent absence from work without proper cause and documentation.\n\nConsumption of unauthorised alcohol or illicit drugs whilst undertaking Wannon Water duties or in a Wannon Water workplace.\n\nViolation of any local, state or federal laws.\n\nImproper use of Internet or email services.\n\n\nPROCEDURE\nWhere disciplinary action becomes necessary, the following options will form part of the process.\n\nDiscussion & Verbal Warning \nThis is a verbal conversation where the Employee and relevant Manager will discuss the event/incident.  This will result in recommendations for improvements, together with an action or training plan with timelines where appropriate.\n\nDepending on the seriousness of the incident or conduct requiring disciplinary action and in consultation with People & Wellbeing a First Written Warning may also be issued along with this initial Discussion/Verbal Warning.\n\nFirst Written Warning\nIf there is no significant improvement as agreed above, or another incident takes place, or the seriousness of the incident or conduct requiring disciplinary action is such that this is the initial step, the Senior Manager People & Wellbeing in consultation with the employee\u2019s manager, will issue a written warning.  The Managing Director or a General Manager is required to countersign this written warning.\n\nThe Employee has the right to discuss this written warning and comment in writing.  If the Employee wishes to discuss the matter, they may elect the conversation to take place in the presence of a representative chosen by the Employee.  The Senior Manager People & Wellbeing and the employees Manager will be in attendance.\n\nDocuments related to the matter will be placed on the Employee\u2019s personnel file.\n\nFurther or Final Written Warning\nA further or final written warning can be issued if there has been no marked improvement as agreed above, or another incident occurs.  The Senior Manager People & Wellbeing and the employees Manager will complete the written warning, detailing the reasons for a further or final warning.  The Managing Director or a General Manager is required to countersign this warning.  \n\nA copy will be placed on the Employee\u2019s personnel file.  This stage may also incur loss of any privileges obtained with the position if deemed appropriate.\n\nTermination\nIn the event of a serious breach of policy or procedure that has the potential to harm the employee, colleagues or members of the public or behaviours or conduct that constitutes criminal actions the employee will be terminated without notice.\nFurther to written warnings being issued, should any further misconduct occur, the employee may also be terminated without notice.  \nIt is the responsibility of the Senior Manager People & Resilience and the employees Manager to thoroughly investigate a serious incident to ensure that termination without notice is warranted.  Documentation of reason, and action taken, will be placed on the personnel file.\n\nImmediate Termination\nWhere the incident or conduct has been unacceptable and of a serious nature, immediate dismissal may take place.  Examples of this type of incident or conduct include (but are not limited to):\nWilful or deliberate unacceptable behaviour by an employee.\nImminent and serious risk to the health and safety of any person.\nSerious damage to or loss of assets.\nReduction in the reputation and/or viability of Wannon Water.\nAccessing, storing or dissemination of child pornography.\nFraud against Wannon Water, customer of Wannon Water or associated organisation.\nPhysical assault of an employee, customer, or other work-related person.\nBeing under the influence or adversely affected by drugs in the workplace.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Managing Director or a General Manager to conduct the termination.\n\nDocuments of reason and action taken will be placed on the Employee\u2019s personnel file.\n\nDOCUMENTATION\nNIL.\n\nREFERENCES\nWannon Water Code of Conduct\n\nWannon Water Harassment and Bullying Free Workplace\n\nDOCUMENT CONTROL\n", "Consequence Of Employee Misconduct.DOCX"], ["Purpose\nTo provide practical guidance for the management of Contractors to eliminate potential harm to human health, the environment, drinking water and our operations, as far as reasonably practicable, and to ensure compliance with regulatory obligations.\n\nContractors, a person or company engaged to work for us, are an integral part of our operations and make up a significant proportion of our workforce.

A cyber security incident is any event that threatens the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of the organisation\u2019s information and operational assets. The framework and processes set out in this document align to Wannon Water\u2019s Cyber Resilience Strategy, the business Emergency Management Plan (EMP), and the best practice standards for cyber security incident management (NIST 800-61 and ISO-27035).\nThis Framework document should be read in conjunction with the individual cyber incident management plan scenario playbooks (Playbooks) to ensure a robust and holistic approach is taken to managing cyber incidents. The individual Playbooks provide the Wannon Water Information Security Incident Response Team (ISIRT) with step by step instructions for each of the following incident types:\nData Breach\nThird Party Data Breach\nRansomware\nPhishing\nSystem Compromise\nDenial of Service (DOS)\n\nHaving an effective incident reporting and investigation framework enables Wannon Water to meet legislative obligations, ensure lessons are learned from incidents occurring, and help identify controls to prevent reoccurrence. Wannon Water is exposed to numerous incidents of varying type and severity levels ranging from incidents that can be managed on-site locally (e.g. an isolated security breach) to wide scale incidents involving service disruption across multiple systems.\n\n\nScope\nIn scope\nThe Wannon Water Cyber Security Incident Management Framework encompasses the identification and management of incidents:\nin the Information Technology (IT) domain;\nin the Operational Technology (OT) domain;\nthat are defined in the EMP and have as a contributing root cause a cyber security event. For example, the compromise of an OT SCADA system by software infection which ultimately impacts water flow or water quality would involve the instigation of cyber incident management processes (the Playbook linked to System Compromise) under this framework, as well as the instigation of incident management processes related to the non-cyber impacts of the compromise (as per the EMP). \n\nOut of scope\nThe following items are considered out of scope for the application of this framework:\nThe management and treatment of Incidents that are not related to cyber security factors and do not have cyber security issues as a contributing cause of any incident (i.e. no impact to systems, technology or data and no causes related to the materialisation of cyber security threats). \nBusiness continuity or business response beyond technical IT and OT controls.\n\nIncident Management Lifecycle\nCyber Security Incidents are managed in accordance with the guidelines set out in the NIST 800-61 Incident Response Lifecycle and accord to four main phases. These phases represent the application of best practice incident management processes:\nPreparation\nDetection & Analysis\nContainment, Eradication & Recovery\nPost-Incident Activity\nFigure 1 shows a visual representation of the 4 phases.\nThis document examines all 4 phases from a holistic standpoint, whilst the individual Playbooks (representing incident scenarios) focus on the fine details of phases 2 and 3. Where there is variation from what is described in this document for phases 1 and 4, this is detailed in the individual Playbooks. \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 NIST 800-61 Incident Response Lifecycle\n\n\nThe EMP sets out 3 levels of severity for the classification of incidents \u2013 in order of increasing severity: (i) Operational, (ii) Enhanced Operational, and (iii) Incident Management Team (IMT). Each level also has increasing levels of incident complexity, employee involvement, resourcing, internal liaison and external liaison.  \n\nImpacts from a cyber security incident are commonly graded on a severity scale with 5 levels: \n\nNone/negligible; \nMinor; \nModerate; \nHigh; \nVery High. \n\nRefer to Appendix A for a detailed description of the cyber security incident impact types against these severity levels. \n\nA formal declaration of a cyber security incident could ultimately lead to the declaration of an Emergency, as defined in the EMP (p14). In this instance, procedures for cyber security incident remediation and Emergency remediation may be applied conjunctionally to aid in incident recovery. \n\n\nResponse \nThis document sets out how to deal with cyber security incidents as per the 4 phases defined in the previous section:\nPreparation\nDetection & Analysis\nContainment, Eradication & Recovery\nPost-Incident Activity\nEach phase will be detailed in this section. The information hereafter should be considered in conjunction with the Playbook relevant to the incident scenario. \n\nPreparation\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Preparation phase of the Incident Response Lifecycle\n\nOverarching responsibility for implementing the incident response framework for Wannon Water falls to the Information Security Incident Response Team. The ISIRT is an organisational function that covers the process for information security incidents and is focused mainly on IT security incidents. At a bare minimum, the members of the ISIRT accord with the following organisational roles:\nInformation Security Manager\nIT Operations Manager\nChief Information Officer\nManager Risk & Resilience\nEnterprise Network Technical Lead\n\nAdditional members may be recruited into the ISIRT from time to time as needed to meet the requirements of incidents as they occur.\n\nIncident response methodologies typically emphasise preparation\u2014not only establishing an incident response capability so that the organization is ready to respond to incidents, but also preventing incidents by ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are sufficiently secure. Although the ISIRT is not wholly responsible for incident prevention, its role is fundamental to the success of incident response programs.\n\nAdditional measures to ensure adequate preparation for the occurrence of a cyber security incident are listed as follows:\n\nEnsure an updated and reviewed contact matrix is maintained, detailing key contacts both within and external to Wannon Water. Information to include email addresses, phone numbers, and if applicable public encryption keys. Refer also to the Core Services Map documents for critical system ownership and information;\nOn-call information and escalation criteria; \nEstablished incident management and risk reporting system, supported by issue tracking and problem management functionality (e.g. IRIS or equivalent risk management system);\nSecure storage systems for securing incident history, forensic evidence etc.;\n24 hour/365 days monitoring of key security variables (logging and event management) via a dedicated Security Operations Centre (SOC);\nCyber security education, training and awareness programs (supported by, for example, phishing awareness campaigns);\nVulnerability management programs to detect and mitigate system security vulnerabilities;\nIn-house or externally available digital forensic capability, including evidence gathering resources such as chain of custody forms, digital cameras, audio recorders, evidence storage bags etc.;\nConfiguration Management Database (CMDB) to include configuration items for all critical systems, Operating Systems (OSs), applications, network devices, and secure configuration baseline for critical systems;\nNetwork diagrams and listings of all critical digital assets (e.g. servers ,databases and OT devices);\nDocumentation for OSs, applications and network security appliances (e.g. firewalls and intrusion detection systems);\nReady access to clean images of Standard Operating Environment (SOE) OS and key applications, to aid in restoration and recovery. These artefacts should be a part of a data and system backup management plan. \nAdherence to a published schedule for testing the Cyber Security Incident Response Plan and Playbooks via simulation or tabletop exercises. These will be used to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the Framework and should feed into the Lessons Learned aspect of Phase 4. \nConfiguration documentation, where available, for OT devices.\n\n\n\nDetection and Analysis\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Detection & Analysis phase of the Incident Response Lifecycle\n\n\nCyber security incidents are highly variable in nature, so capturing common characteristics for all of them is not possible. An incident can evolve from a cyber security event that does not conform to expected behaviour or parameters. This type of event may or may not lead to the formal identification of an incident (See Appendix D). Once a particular incident has been identified (for example, Ransomware), the appropriate Playbook should be consulted and read in conjunction with this document. Following detection and analysis, incident triage and classification will need to be applied. \nDetection: The detection of a cyber security incident can come from many sources. The most common for Wannon Water would include:\nSecurity Operations Centre alerting/notification\nEnd user/employee\nWannon Water Customer\nHelpdesk\nVendor \nVulnerability assessment\nAudit\n\nAnalysis: At the point of notification, it is not certain that the alert will result in a formal incident being identified. It is the task of the ISIRT to determine if an incident is to be declared by applying a triage and classifying the incident. Triage will determine the incident severity, and the classification will determine what Playbook/s should be consulted for progressing incident remediation. Considerations for the ISIRT include:\nAssessment of risk\nDetermine scope of impact \u2013 IT and / or OT?\nIs company proprietary data involved?\nIs Personally Identifiable Information (PII) involved?\nInterview the notification source/s\nIdentification of affected systems and information assets, including the BIL ratings of impacted information.\nData collation\nCriticality of the systems involved\nWhere OT systems are involved, the businesses capacity to continue operations with those systems degraded or unavailable\nDuring the Triage and Classification process, the ISIRT should convene and initiate a conference call with all concerned stakeholders. Required and optional attendees are listed in Table 1. \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Conference Call Attendees\n\n* Optional attendees (dependent on incident type). \nHighlighted rows reflect conference call attendees if escalation is indicated as per Tables 2 and 3\nOnce all required members have been added into the conference call, the ISIRT should ensure that the meeting events are carefully recorded in meeting minutes or voice recorded. This information will be used to help complete an Incident Report or Incident Log if an incident is subsequently declared. An Incident Log template is included in Appendix E. \nAlthough the primary reason for gathering evidence during an incident is to resolve the incident, it may also be needed for legal proceedings. In such cases, it is important to clearly document how all evidence, including compromised systems, has been preserved. Evidence should be collected according to procedures that meet all applicable laws and regulations which have been developed from previous discussions with legal staff and appropriate law enforcement agencies. This is to ensure that any evidence is admissible in court. In addition, evidence should be accounted for at all times: whenever evidence is transferred from person to person, chain of custody forms should detail the transfer and include each party\u2019s signed authorisation. A detailed log should therefore be kept for all evidence. \n\nApplying a triage will help to determine the incident severity and classification. Given that the full impact and root cause of the incident may not be immediately evident, investigations should continue until this is established. Determining whether a particular event is actually an incident is sometimes a matter of judgement. It may be necessary to collaborate with other technical and information security personnel to make a decision. The key objectives of the meeting for the ISIRT and other conference call attendees should be to:\nPerform an incident analysis based on the evidence provided and the source data. Consider the method of detection and any people involved in the escalation to the ISIRT;\nTriage: Complete an evaluation of the incident severity based on the incident characteristics identified and the escalation criteria as defined in Appendix A. This evaluation will assist in grading incident severity on the scale of 5 levels from \u2018None/Negligible\u2019 to \u2018Very High\u2019. If an incident has characteristics/symptoms that span multiple rows of the table, the incident severity will be determined by the greatest severity rating of all row items. For example, looking at two line-items in the Appendix A matrix, if a security incident has resulted in a significant impact to production (high severity rating) which also affects critical OT systems (very high severity rating), then the incident severity determined by triage should be \u2018Very High\u2019. Appendix B contains an extract of the EMP to be used for determining if \u2018Enhanced Operational\u2019 or \u2018IMT\u2019 levels of incident management need to be applied for IT security related threats as per the requirements of the Emergency Management Plan;  \nClassification: Consult the relevant Playbook for the incident type identified. For example, dealing with the disclosure of login credentials to unauthorised external parties resulting from a targeted email scam, refer to the \u2018Phishing\u2019 playbook. Apply any steps from the Playbook for the ongoing analysis and remediation of the incident;\nContinue triage and include (if necessary) relevant managers/team leads as impacted areas are identified. Refer to details in the Core Service Map Documents;  \nIdentify the primary root cause, data collection and forensics requirements;\nIdentify senior stakeholders and commence notification processes as per the Communications Plan (see Appendix C). Incidents classified as \u2018High\u2019 or \u2018Very High\u2019 will have communications handled as described in Table C1, and \u2018Medium\u2019 or lower handled as described in Table C2.\nEnsure that all decisions and analysis are recorded in the Incident Log.\n\nFor example, in Table 2 below, the determination of the cyber security incident severity is made in step 1 by the ISIRT (or individual team members of the ISIRT) by looking at the impact type and severity ratings shown in Appendix A. Up to this point in time the incident severity has not been confirmed. As such, all incidents should be treated as potentially serious until the triage is complete (requiring ISIRT involvement from the point where the incident report is received). \nA second decision is then required (step 2) to determine if the EMP needs to be invoked. In this case, refer to Appendix B. The table in Appendix B will assist in determining if the EMP provisions should be utilised (i.e. if the table indicates that the EMP incident classification level is \u2018Enhanced Operational\u2019 or \u2018IMT\u2019). Step 3 follows the decision points around whether to engage external parties (by referring to Table 3), and step 4 involves implementing the appropriate Playbook/s. \n\nTable 2\u2013- Triage Evaluation and Escalation Matrix\n\nTo put this in context, refer to Figure 4, which is an extract of the Process Workflow on page 3. For the Detection and Analysis phase of the Incident Response Lifecycle, the four steps in Table 2 have been superimposed onto this diagram for clarity. \nFigure 4 \u2013 Detection and Analysis Phase: Escalation and Engagement\n\nThe criteria for which external agencies to engage and under what circumstances (step 3), can be found in Table 3. This sets out the minimum rating for (a) cyber security incident/s under this framework; and (b) the EMP, needed to engage key external agencies under defined circumstances. For example, when forensic analysis or assistance is required that is not found in-house at Wannon Water, the DPCV cyber security team should be engaged when the minimum cyber incident severity rating is \u2018Moderate\u2019 or higher. Under the EMP requirements, the DPCV cyber security team should be engaged when the classification is \u2018Enhanced Operational\u2019 or higher. Examine Appendices A and B to determine what the escalation requirements are. In the event the decision to escalate comes from one of the two frameworks, but not both, the escalation should proceed.\n\nTable 3 \u2013 Third Party Escalation Decision Matrix \n\n\nIncident Response\u2013- Containment, Eradication & Recovery\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Containment, Eradication & Recovery phase of the Incident Response Lifecycle\n\n\nContainment: Containment is important to ensure that the incident doesn\u2019t overwhelm Wannon Water\u2019s resources or produce additional ongoing impacts to systems or information assets. Containment provides time for developing a tailored remediation strategy. An essential part of containment is decision-making (e.g. whether to shut down a system, disconnect it from a network, disable certain functions etc.). Such decisions are much easier to make if there are predetermined strategies and procedures for containing the incident. Wannon Water manages this risk through the use of detailed Playbook instructions to deal with containment.  \nContainment strategies vary based on the type of incident. For example, the strategy for containing an email-borne malware infection is quite different from that of a network-based dDoS attack. Refer to the correct Playbook for full instructions. \n\nEradication:  After an incident has been contained, eradication may be necessary to eliminate incident symptoms, such as deleting malware, disabling breached user accounts, as well as identifying and mitigating all vulnerabilities that were exploited. During eradication, it is important to identify all affected servers and endpoint devices so that they can be remediated. For some incidents, eradication is either not necessary or is performed during recovery. Follow the Playbook instructions for effective eradication steps. \n\nRecovery: Implement the Playbook requirements to assist with effective incident recovery. Examples may include administrators restoring systems to normal operation and confirming that the systems are functioning normally. Recovery may involve such actions as restoring systems from clean backups, rebuilding systems from scratch, replacing compromised files with clean versions, installing patches, changing passwords, disabling any vulnerable services or components, and tightening network perimeter security (e.g. firewall rulesets and boundary router access control lists). Higher levels of system logging, network monitoring or the deployment of additional security controls are also often part of the recovery process. Once a resource is successfully attacked, it is often attacked again, so full recovery should be robust and completed in conjunction with the Lessons Learned section below. \n\nIn summary, the \u2018Containment, Eradication and Recovery\u2019 phase is a critical part of the Incident Response Lifecycle, the main objectives of which are as follows:\nConfirm the criticality of data and systems effected (referring to the relevant Wannon Water Incident Response Playbook), and assign prioritised remediation tasks and follow-up timeframes so that the relevant support teams can contain the incident;\nRemove all signs, symptoms and causes of the incident from affected systems to ensure the problem is eradicated;\nRecover and restore systems as necessary to resolve the incident; \nProvide updates to identified stakeholders in line with the Communications Plan (see Appendix C), notify any affected users of the incident remediation, and if required, notify the regulatory authorities (dependent on the nature of the incident).\n\nIncident Closure: Close out all linked service tickets updating details as necessary and capturing process remediation requirements as identified. Send incident closure email to relevant staff as identified on the Communications Plan.\n\n\n\nPost Incident Activity / Lessons Learned\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Post Incident Activity phase of the Incident Response Lifecycle\n\n\nOnce the incident has been closed, post incident activities should be conducted and should incorporate a \u2018Lessons Learned\u2019 aspect. A post-incident review should cover off points to enquire whether the incident was managed effectively with a view towards incorporating any potential improvements into the management of future incidents. These should include:\nConfirmation that the incident has been resolved and the Incident Log is reviewed for closure;\nInitial mitigation strategies review\u2013- Was the incident contained? Was process followed, and were the right people involved?\nCommunications review \u2013 were the correct people notified as per the Communications Plan and were updates timely and accurate? Were all incident activities recorded appropriately?\nWere any outstanding or unresolved issues or vulnerabilities captured in the problem management system or risk management system (IRIS)? This will be required for mitigation of like impacts during any future incidents. \nReview remediation activities \u2013 did the restoration activity work as expected? Was required system documentation available and accurate? Are any updates required for the incident response documents and framework? Update process, framework and Playbook documentation accordingly in line with the lessons learned.\nAn effective Incident Response Framework should involve testing the Plan and Playbooks on a regular basis. This can take the form of exercises or simulations of varying complexity (from a simple tabletop simulation right up to a full test of all aspects of incident management just as if a real incident had occurred). The schedule for testing of the plans should be published and adhered to, with the outcomes of the testing feeding into the Lessons Learned component of incident management. \n\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\nWhile every incident may be different, the roles and responsibilities for key personnel are as described in the following RACI Charts (Tables 4a and 4b). The initial incident triage will determine if the Victorian Department of Premier and the Cabinet (DPCV) (or other external party) is required to be engaged to facilitate incident containment and remediation. This determination will be performed by the Information Security Incident Response Team (ISIRT). \n\nTable 4a sets out the roles and responsibilities where it has been determined by the ISIRT that no DPCV Cyber Security Unit (CSU) response is required, and Table 4b where the team has decided that DPCV CSU needs to be engaged to effect incident remediation. The decision to engage or not to engage the CSU should accord with the criteria set out in Table 3 on page 11 but the final decision is entirely at the discretion of the ISIRT and may be dependent on factors such as the requirement for additional or specialist resources.\n\nTable 4a \u2013 Cyber Incident Roles and Responsibilities: No DPCV CSU involvement\n\n\nTable 4b \u2013 Cyber Incident Roles and Responsibilities: DPCV CSU involvement\nR \u2013 Responsible, A-Accountable, C-Consulted, I-Informed\n\n\u2018Wannon Water Technical Teams\u2019 includes any team or function that manages or has responsibility for information resources, technology, platforms or expertise related to the nature of the incident under assessment. \nDEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS\nAvailability\u2013- The information security concept that applies to ensuring that information and information systems are available when needed.\n\nCMDB \u2013 Configuration Management Database\n\nConfidentiality \u2013 The information security concept that applies to preventing unauthorised access to protected and sensitive information assets.\n\nDenial of Service (DOS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) Attack \u2013 An attack intended to overwhelm or overload a system or host in order to cause disruption and service outage.

Stakeholders should be kept informed and up to date on the status and resolution of incidents and potential incidents. \nThe tables below provide guidelines for communicating with stakeholders during cyber security incidents. It provides detail including the target audience and channel of communications.\nCyber Security Incident Communications \u2013 Major or above rating\nThe following notification mechanisms shall apply to significant incidents rated as Major or above that impact multiple Wannon Water sites or systems.\n\nTable C1 \u2013 Communications Plan: High or Very High severity ratings\n\nCyber Security Incident Communications \u2013 Limited or lower rating\nThe following notification mechanisms shall apply to significant incidents with localised impact rated as Limited or lower.\n\nTable C2 \u2013 Communications Plan: Medium or lower severity ratings\n\nTables C1 and C2 refer to the three cyber-security foundational concepts underlying the protection of information assets: confidentiality, integrity and availability. Consult Section 5 \u2013 Key Definitions and Acronyms for a full description of these concepts, and how they apply to data protection. \nExternal Notifications and Communications\nThe VPDSS and the WoVG Cyber Incident Management Plan require the mandatory reporting of any cyber incident impacting an information asset of Business Impact Level (BIL) 2 or higher.  During a cyber incident if the ISIRT determines an impact on an asset of BIL rating 2 or higher, the Information Security Manager or the Chief Information Officer will make a report to:\nDepartment of Government Service Cyber Incident Response Service (DGS CIRS)\nOffice of the Victorian Information Commissioner (OVIC)\nDEECA Water Duty Officer\nThe ISIRT will co-ordinate technical communications with OVIC and CIRS\nAll external media communications will be via Wannon Water standard external communication channels.  ISIRT members will refer all requests for information from external parties to the ISIRT chair.\nNote that if the cyber incident is significant enough to trigger an IMT, the communications provisions of Wannon Water\u2019s Emergency Management Plan will be activated.  The ISIRT will continue to liaise with support agencies on a technical level. \nCurrent reporting obligations are summarised in table C3 below:\nTable C3: Notification requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX D: DEFINITIONS AND INCIDENT CATEGORIES\nKey Definitions\nWannon Water formally define (and differentiate between) security \u2018incidents\u2019 and \u2018events\u2019 in order to establish the scope of response efforts and create a foundation for consistency in the categorization, communication, and handling of security-related events/incidents.\n\nEvent\nAn event is any observable occurrence in a system or network.\nExamples include:\nA user connecting to a file share\nA server receiving a request for a web page\nA user sending an email\nA firewall blocking a connection attempt\nA discrete non operational SCADA alarm (i.e. Communications Fail) \n\n\nIncident\nA security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.\nExamples include:\nAn attacker commands a botnet to send high volumes of connection requests to a web server, causing it to crash.\nUsers are tricked into opening a \u2018quarterly report\u2019 sent via email that is actually malware; running the tool infects their computers and establishes connections with an external host.\nAn attacker obtains sensitive data and threatens that the details will be released publicly if the organization does not pay a designated sum of money or alter a business practice.\nA user provides or exposes sensitive information to others through peer-to-peer file sharing services.\nUsers report abnormal data or control operation to an OT device / system\nSystems report unusual physical access.\n\nIncidents often result in negative consequences to the organization, such as:\nNetwork and/or SCADA system outages\nUnauthorized use of system privileges\nUnauthorized access to sensitive data\nExecution of malware that destroys data\nReduction of water quality\nEnvironmental impacts from a spillage\nAPPENDIX E: INCIDENT LOG TEMPLATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQUICK REFERENCE WORKFLOW \u2013 CYBER SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE\n\n", "Cyber Security Incident Response Plan Framework.DOCX"], ["Purpose\nWannon Water is continually looking to implement and evolve workable and innovative flexibility options consistent with our values and operating environment.\n\nWannon Water believes we can provide additional benefits to employees as they look to deliver on team and organisational objectives.\n\nThis procedure provides guidance to both employees and managers on flexible working. \nScope\nThis procedure applies to all employees and does not alter nor override the terms and conditions of the Wannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020.\n\nProcedure\nWannon Water recognises the potential benefits of providing flexible working arrangements to assist employees with balancing the demands of work with their family and/or personal responsibilities.\n\nFlexible working arrangements can also benefit businesses by increasing staff attraction and retention, decreasing absenteeism, and achieving greater productivity through increased employee job satisfaction.\n\nFlexibility is also an enabler of improved gender outcomes and financial inclusion.\n\nPositive working relationships, trust, performance, and regular communication between employees remains critical to the success of flexible work practices and an organisation\u2019s ability to continue to evolve flexible working.\nPrinciples\nWannon Water\u2019s approach to flexibility is supported by principles that guide employees and managers to have open and transparent conversations around what might and might not be available for each situation.\n\nPrinciples that need to be considered as part of all flexibility opportunities include:\n\nZero Harm and the values of trust and integrity remain at the core of flexible work.\nEvery role should be able to access some form of flexibility, noting not all types of flexibility will work for every role.\nWhat is or is not possible for some, should not limit what is possible for others.\nWannon Water remains predominantly a physically present workforce due to the benefits this brings.\nManagers and employees are to have open conversations and work together to explore what might be workable.\nThere is no expectation that employees must work flexibly, or feel that they need to work flexibly.\nFlexibility will need to reflect and consider our current operating environment and how we work, however this should not be a barrier to considering new opportunities or ways of working.\nFlexibility is subject to review if performance, service, or Zero Harm outcomes are reduced or are at risk or if the needs of the wider team change.\nAn individual\u2019s flexibility agreement must not:\nmaterially change the nature of work for an individual\ncreate ongoing additional work or stress for the individual, manager or other employees\nnegatively impact the ongoing achievement of team and organisational objectives\nrely on a requirement to back fill by contractor, consultant or other means.\n\nTypes of Flexible Working Arrangements\nEmployees can access forms of flexible working arrangements including:\nVariation to work hours (or worksite / remote work)\nAdhoc Flexibility\nPurchased Leave Model (48/52, 49/52, 50/52, 51/52)\nWork From Home (WFH)\nTransition to Retirement \nRegular access of accrued leave.\n\nVariation to work hours (or worksite / remote work)\nAn Individual Flexibility Arrangement is an agreement under Clause 17 of the Wannon Water Enterprise Agreement to vary work hours (and days) on an ongoing basis. \n\nAn employee can apply for an Individual Flexibility Arrangement to amend their start and finish times by a margin of up to 45 minutes or reduce their meal break of 45 minutes by 15 minutes to a minimum unpaid meal break of 30 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, any employee may wish to increase their unpaid meal break to a maximum period of 1 hour 30 minutes.\n\nAn employee can apply to modify the spread of working hours over a working week to increase the number of hours worked on a particular day, (to a maximum of 9.5 hours), therefore lessening the amount of hours worked on other day(s) during the week.\n\nThis arrangement may also cover work site start and finish locations for a particular day or work pattern.\n\nEither party can terminate an Individual Flexibility Working Arrangement giving 28 days\u2019 notice, or earlier by agreement.\n\n\nAdhoc Flexibility (up to one hour)\nNominally there are no provisions for short (up to one hour) absences from the workplace without applying for some type of leave, however, Wannon Water permit short duration ad hoc absences on a \u2018give and take\u2019 basis where a foundation of trust exists.\nEmployees may request to take up to a one-hour absence from the workplace to meet personal commitments on a give and take basis. Employees wishing to access ad hoc flexibility should discuss with and receive permission from their manager before any absence occurs.\n\nManagers are responsible for ensuring that absences are irregular and based on \u2018give and take\u2019. For regular absences an employee will need to apply for an Individual Flexibility Arrangement.\n\n\nPurchased Leave (48/52, 49/52, 50/52, 51/52)\n\nEmployees may request to access a Purchase Leave arrangement, providing the employee the opportunity to purchase up to 4 weeks additional leave, over 12 months, in return for a pro-rata reduction in their salary. Refer the Purchase Leave procedure.\n\nAll employees other than casual or fixed term (less than 12 months) are eligible to apply for Purchased Leave.\n\nPurchased leave enables an employee to request up to four additional weeks of leave over a 12 month period, in return for a pro-rata reduction in their salary. This reduction is averaged out over 12 months and as such, approval is on the basis that it is a 12 month fixed term agreement.\n\nEmployees are to indicate in their required for Purchased leave when the additional leave is planned to be taken. Any   variation to the period of planned leave must be approved by the relevant manager and the Remuneration Coordinator is to be notified in writing of the approved leave amendment.\n\nAn approved Purchased Leave arrangement will remain in place until the 12 month expiry date. In only specific instances, as outlined in the Wannon Water EBA, an employee may apply for the purchased leave model of employment to cease before the nominal expiry date.\n\nAn employee participating in a Purchased Leave Model of Employment will become a fractional employee at the relevant fraction of a full-time workload, with all benefits accruing on that basis over the 12 month period.\n\nThe commencement of a Purchased Leave Model of Employment must be at the start of a pay period or where agreed at the commencement of the next anniversary date of commencement of employment.\n\n\nPurchased leave must be taken within the approved 12 month period in blocks of 5 consecutive leave days. All purchased leave accrued under the Purchased Leave Model of Employment must be used before the 12 month period expires.\n\nAn employee with more than 15 weeks of long service leave accrued will be required to utilise those entitlements before applying for purchased leave.\n\nSuperannuation\nWhere an employee elects to take up the Purchased Leave Model of Employment, Wannon Water shall only be obliged to pay employer superannuation contributions at the applicable pro-rata rate. Where an employee chooses to maintain superannuation contributions at their full-time employment basis rate they can do so, subject to the requirements of the relevant superannuation scheme, via additional pre and/or post tax superannuation contributions.\nCessation of Employment\nAn employee who discontinues their employment whilst on the Purchased Leave Model of Employment will be paid for unused purchased leave at the appropriate rate. Where other entitlements have accrued at the full-time rate, any termination payments will be made at the full-time rate. Where an employee has exceeded their pro rata entitlement to purchased leave, this will be deducted from the employee\u2019s final pay.\nReview of Arrangements\nAn employee may apply for the Purchased Leave Model of Employment arrangement to cease before the 12-month expiry period for circumstances relating to changes of an individual\u2019s personal financial demands or other exceptional circumstances. In these circumstances, the employee will be requested to use all of their additional purchased leave. If an employee has utilised more purchased leave than they have paid for through payroll deductions arrears will continue to be deducted from the employees pay until reconciled.\nParental Leave\nThis flexibility provision aims to provide eligible employees access to parental leave for both primary and secondary caregivers depending on their individual circumstances. Wannon Water also offers flexible return to work options for employees returning from parental leave. For more information, see clause 49 of the Wannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020.\n\nSerious Illness\nThis flexibility provision aims to provide eligible employees access to a variety of leave provisions in times of serious illness. This includes sick leave, long service leave and special leave without pay options. For more information see clause 48, and clause 44 of the Wannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020.\n\nWork From Home (WFH)\nWannon Water is committed to providing a safe and healthy place of work for employees, including those who because of their role and circumstances, can undertake some work from home. Work from home for the purposes of this procedure means an employee\u2019s place of residence and is different to \u201cremote work\u201d or \u201cwork site\u201d. \n\nThere are two categories of WFH that might be available.\n\nAn ongoing arrangement that is formalised through an Individual Flexibility Agreement as part of a normal work pattern; and\n\nAn informal Short Term WFH arrangement in response to a one off or short term change of circumstances.\n\nBoth opportunities require pre-qualification. As per all flexibility options at Wannon Water, any agreement must adhere to Wannon Water\u2019s flexibility principals for them to be successful. WFH is subject to additional criteria including:\n\n\nSuitability of the role for work from home;\nEmployee performance and core competency considerations;\nProductivity will be maintained or increased;\nSuitable work environment at home;\nInternet connectivity, access to Citrix and work systems and programs relative to role requirements;\nImpact on others (team and other internal and external stakeholders);\nAligning where possible to \u201cteam days\u201d;\nCannot be a substitute for caring duties; and\nAny other considerations that may be identified based on individual circumstances.\n\nAll terms and conditions of employment that apply whilst working on-site at Wannon Water remain unchanged and are applicable to work from home. Similarly, all Wannon Water policies and procedures extend to WFH.\n\nEmployees should be aware of the following matters when considering working from home:\n\nWannon Water\u2019s OH&S policies and procedures remain applicable;\nThe requirement for the employee to take reasonable care for their own health & safety and notify their Manager of any risks or injuries;\nSecurity of information, data integrity and privacy;\nWannon Water\u2019s policies and procedures relating to use of IT resources;\nIn cases of a temporary disability which inhibits attendance at work, there is requirement for a medical certificate stating that the employee is able to work safely from home;\nImpact on employee and career development activities and experiences;\nThe need to undertake a WFH e-learn module every 12 months;\nWFH is not provided as an opportunity to avoid workplace conflicts or interpersonal problems that may be occurring; and\nEmployees agree that Wannon Water is not responsible for any liability claim by a third party except to the extent caused by the negligent act, error or omission of Wannon Water.\n\nWork From Home Formal (Ongoing)\nEmployees can apply for up to a maximum of 40% of their current contracted hours as an ongoing work from home arrangement. See below table.\n\n\nIf you wish to access the formal (ongoing) work from home requirements, you should discuss with your manager and complete the Flexible Working Request eform. The eForm will require you to complete a Working from Home Self-Assessment, complete an eLearn module \u201cWorking from Home\u201d, the (ECHO) Ergonomic Assessment and declare that the homework locations meets the requirements of a safe workspace. The flexible work arrangement may not commence until approval is granted.\n\nThe maximum percentage may vary for different individuals and teams once the principles and criteria are considered. This will need to be assessed for decision by the manager of the individual or team at that time.\n\nThe following additional considerations should form part of an assessment for exceeding the 40% maximum work from home:\n\nLength of tenure and experience\nType of employment (fixed term, casual, ongoing)\nImpact of increased work from home on team collaboration and the employee\u2019s deliverables\nNeed for employee to attend the onsite workplace to undertake work\nNeed for employee to access equipment or machinery to undertake work\nImpact on face-to-face interaction for coaching, counselling, building rapport, training, negotiation or critical decision making\nMedical/Mental Health conditions (evidence from medical practitioner)\nResidential address of the employee\nAny other considerations that may be identified based on individual circumstances\n\nFollowing assessment, the manager will consult with People & Wellbeing to ensure a consistency in application across the workplace prior to approval. Additionally, the arrangement should be reviewed as required and as a minimum at interim and annual review periods to ensure it is still working effectively for both parties and noted in review notes.\n\nAn Individual Flexibility Agreement - WFH should aim to ensure the employees work pattern includes attending the physical workspace on \u201cteam days\u201d (or at a minimum \u201chalf days\u201d) where possible. Team days are those days determined by the Manager where most of the team should attempt to be physically present to support cohesion and deliverables. Every team is different and therefore this currently remains at the discretion of management.\n\nSwitching agreed WFH days is available within your normal work pattern to accommodate business or personal requirements and will require manager approval.\n\nShort Term - Work From Home\nShort term WFH is the opportunity for employees pre-qualified to work from home to do so in response to a one off or a short-term change of circumstances for either a part or full day(s).\n\nShort term WFH may be available to employees depending on circumstances, workload and work requirements. Examples may include training, work related study, project work or contractors servicing your home which require you to be present to allow access.\n\nShort Term WFH is not suitable nor available for supporting caring duties but may be available where only light supervision is required.\n\n\u201cLight supervision\u201d is defined by Wannon Water as when an employee\u2019s circumstances mean they might need to be at their home to supervise a member(s) of their immediate household however they are able to effectively work with very minimal disruption to the workday. To qualify, the employee must have the ability to attend meetings and be available as required for extended periods of time. In short, they only require intermittent and infrequent engagement with those they might be supervising as they are relatively self-sufficient.\n\nThis is different to \u201ccaring\u201d where caring requires the provision of ongoing care and attention to another person who is wholly or substantially dependent on the employee for their day-to-day activities. The duty of care from the carer means it is not reasonable for the person being cared for to be left alone for any extended period of time as they are unable to care for themselves and require constant monitoring. In these circumstances, leave provision or alternative flexibility options may be accessed.\n\nIf you wish to access Short term work from home, you should discuss your request with your Manager and complete the Short-Term Work From Home Pre-qualification Checklist. To meet the pre- qualifications requirements the checklist will request you to complete a Working from Home Self- Assessment, complete an eLearn module \u201cWorking from Home\u201d, the (ECHO) Ergonomic Assessment and declare that the home work locations meets the requirements of a safe workspace. The completed checklist must be provided to People & Wellbeing for review, confirmation and filing prior to commencing this form of WFH.\n\nPeople & Wellbeing encourage you to prequalify in anticipation that you may wish to access Short term WFH arrangements. Requests to your manager should occur at your earliest opportunity. Late requests may not be able to be approved due to organisational requirements.\n\nPerformance\n\nEmployees with an annual performance score lower than 60% in the most recent annual review will require approval from People & Wellbeing to access WFH.\n\nEmployees who have had formal conduct or performance management in the preceding 12 months, are not eligible for WFH without approval from People & Wellbeing.\n\nFamily and Personal Circumstances\n\nEmployees who have personal responsibilities such as caring will be expected to manage these responsibilities in a way that allows them to successfully meet their employment obligations. Working from home is not a substitute for regular childcare or other carer\u2019s responsibilities. Employees who work from home must ensure that they have suitable childcare/carer arrangements in place.\n\nSchool Holidays\n\nWannon Water will make available Short Term WFH over school holidays subject to the normal requirements of WFH approval. Up to 100% of an employee work pattern may be available for a maximum of 2 weeks per holiday period, noting this may not be possible for all teams or employees where operational requirements may not allow or need to be shared by team members.\n\nReturn to work after illness or injury\n\nIn cases of an illness or temporary disability which inhibits attendance at work, the Manager should consult with People & Wellbeing to determine if a Return-to-Work Program is needed and/or a medical certificate is required stating that the employee is able to work safely from home.\n\n\n\n\nWork from home conditions\n\nWorking from home can only occur between the hours of 6.00am and 6.00pm, Monday to Friday. Any overtime hours of work must be approved in advance.\n\nWork from home opportunities will not extend to payment of an employee\u2019s expenses such as internet, phone, printing and power. Should an employee wish to utilise a work from home arrangement, it is recommended that they speak to their accountant as they may be able to seek reimbursement of these costs through the Australian Tax Office.\n\nProvision of furniture, equipment and other items\n\nAny employee who successfully applies to WFH will be provided with a laptop, additional screen, headset, mouse, keyboard and the option to have a suitable work chair provided where a new employee has an approved ongoing work from home arrangement in place. Desks or additional equipment remain the responsibility of employees.\n\nEmployees utilising Short Term WFH will be provided with a laptop, headset, mouse and keyboard only.\n\nThe employee agrees to notify Wannon Water within 24 hours, if any problems or difficulties arise with the operation of the furniture or equipment and allow access to replace, service or repair the equipment. Any failed equipment is to be returned to the Wannon Water for repairs.\n\nThose who cease a WFH arrangement are required to return all WFH peripherals.\n\nInsurance \u2013 WFH\n\nThe employee must have current household insurance and agree to inform their household insurer of the home-based work arrangement. The employee must also provide a copy of their insurance \u2018certificate of currency\u2019 to Wannon Water. Wannon Water is not responsible for any liability claim by a third party except to the extent caused by the negligent act error or omission of Wannon Water.\n\nApproval / Disapproval\n\nThe decision to approve a request to work from home rests with the relevant Branch or equivalent Manager or People & Wellbeing where this is required. If necessary, the Branch or equivalent Manager will consult with the People & Wellbeing to determine other potential organisational impacts prior to making a decision.\n\nFollowing in-principle approval, the commencement of an agreement is still subject to a satisfactory workplace self-assessment inspection, provision of satisfactory household insurance, a Workstation Self-Assessment Checklist, work from home e-learn module and the setting of agreement parameters which from part of the application. All working from home agreements must be approved before the arrangement commences.\n\nWhere a WFH application has been disapproved, reasons for the refusal are to be discussed with the applicant by the manager.\n\nIf an employee is not satisfied with their manager\u2019s assessment, they may discuss their circumstances with People & Wellbeing.\n\nTransition to Retirement (TTR)\nTTR allows for ongoing employees who are approaching retirement, the opportunity to plan their departure from Wannon Water, providing mutual benefit to both the employee and Wannon Water. Wannon Water encourages employees to consider entering into a TTR, using the flexible working arrangements outlined in this procedure. \n\nRequest to Transition to Retirement\nA request to TTR is to be to submitted via a Flexible Working Arrangement eForm. This request will specify the date at which employment with Wannon Water will end and cannot normally be extended or renewed beyond that date. \n\nThe period of the TTR is generally up to 12 months and no more than two years and can be terminated by:\ndate of expiry being reached.\nthe employee i.e. by resignation before date of expiry.\nWannon Water under circumstances where employment can be terminated i.e. serious misconduct.\n\nUtilising annual or long service leave during a TTR\n\nWhen requesting a TTR, employees must specify blocks of leave exceeding 3 weeks, that will be taken during the entirety of the TTR. Variations to the planned leave requires approval from the relevant manager, considering organisational impact and standard leave application processes. Approved changes must be notified to People & Wellbeing in writing.\nAnnual or Long Service Leave cannot extend beyond the employee\u2019s final day of physically attending work or performing duties for the organisation.\nIn the instance of illness during leave, employees may convert approved accrued leave to sick leave, if the following are met:\nA medical certificate from a qualified practitioner is provided for the period of illness or injury occurring during the annual or long service leave.\nThe manager is notified within 24 hours of the sick leave, with the certificate submitted within the relevant pay period. \n\nRefusal of request for Flexibility Working Arrangements\nA request for flexible working arrangements will not be unreasonably refused and will be assessed in a timely manner. The employee will receive a written response within 21 days of submitting a request including any reasons for refusing a request (if applicable).  (See Appendix).\n\nReasonable business grounds for refusing a request for flexible working arrangements include:\nThe new arrangement would be too costly for the employer.\nThere is no capacity to change the working arrangements of other employees to accommodate the new working arrangements.\nIt would be impractical to change the working arrangements of others, or to recruit new employees.\nThe new working arrangement would be likely to result in significant loss of efficiency or productivity or have a negative impact on customer service. \n\nIn assessing a request for flexible working arrangements, the following will be considered (where applicable): \nThe employee\u2019s circumstances, including the nature of their caring responsibilities.\nThe consequence for the employee of approving or not approving the arrangement.\nThe benefits to the individual and Wannon Water. \nThe availability of appropriately skilled replacement employees. \nThe health and safety of both the employee and other employees potentially impacted by the flexible working arrangements (for example mental health of the individual or stress caused to other employees).\nAny risks associated with the request.\nThe intended duration of the arrangement. \nWhether the employee has other entitlements available that would be more appropriate in the circumstances; and \nWhether a trial period is required to test the flexible working arrangement and, if so, how long it is required to evaluate the success or otherwise of the new arrangement.\n\nPeople & Wellbeing may recommend an alternative arrangement, that may be appropriate for an employee based on some or all the criteria outlined above.\n\nRequests that are supported by managers on the provision that the flexibility will be back filled by a contractor or consultant, or at additional cost to Wannon Water, will not be approved unless there are extenuating circumstances.\n\n\nReview, vary or cease a flexible working arrangement\n\nAll long term flexible working arrangements should be regularly reviewed. It is recommended that long term flexible working arrangements be reviewed, initially after a period of three months and thereafter at a minimum annually or on an as needs basis based on the operational requirements of the business or personal circumstances of the employee. \n\nFlexible working arrangements can be altered to meet the changing operational requirements of the workplace. \n\nEither party may propose a variation to the flexible working arrangements. Where a current arrangement can no longer be accommodated on reasonable business grounds, the reasons why and available options should be discussed with the employee. It is recommended,that written notice is provided where a regular or ongoing arrangement needs to be changed at least 28 days prior to the change.\n\nRoles and responsibilities\n\nDefinitions \n\n\n\nGovernance\n\nDocument version history\n\n\n\nAppendix 1 \u2013 Document Framework\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Flexible Working Arrangements Procedure.DOCX"], ["Purpose\nThis policy states how our organisation:\nresponds to offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality; and\nprovides, benefits and hospitality. \nThis policy is supports individuals and Wannon Water to avoid conflicts of interest and maintain high levels of integrity and public trust. Wannon Water has issued this policy to support behaviour consistent with the \u201cCode of Conduct for Victorian Public Sector Employees\u201d and the \u201cCode of Conduct for Directors of Victorian Public Entities\u201d (the Code). All employees are required under clause 1.2 of the Code to comply with this policy.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all workplace participants including Directors, employees, contractors, consultants and any individuals or groups undertaking activity for or on behalf of Wannon Water.\nPolicy statement\nThis policy has been developed in accordance with requirements outlined in the minimum accountabilities for the management of gifts, benefits and hospitality issued by the Victorian Public Sector Commission. \nWannon Water is committed to and will uphold the following principles in applying this policy:\nImpartiality - individuals have a duty to place the public interest above their private interests when carrying out their official functions. They will not accept gifts, benefits or hospitality that could raise a reasonable perception of, or actual, bias or preferential treatment. Individuals do not accept offers from those about whom they are likely to make business decisions. \nAccountability - individuals are accountable for:\ndeclaring all non-token offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality; \ndeclining non-token offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality, or where an exception applies under this policy, seeking approval to accept the offer; and\nthe responsible provision of gifts, benefits and hospitality.\nIndividuals with direct reports are accountable for overseeing management of their direct reports\u2019 acceptance or refusal of non-token gifts, benefits and hospitality, modelling good practice and promoting awareness of gifts, benefits and hospitality policies and processes.\nIntegrity -  individuals strive to earn and sustain public trust through providing or responding to offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality in a manner that is consistent with community expectations. Individuals will refuse any offer that may lead to an actual, perceived or potential conflict of interest. \n\nThis is further expressed through Wannon Water\u2019s value of integrity, and demonstrated with the behaviours of:\nBeing open, honest and impartial\nBeing accountable for the commitments made ;and\nBeing fair to myself and others. \nRisk-based approach - Wannon Water, through its policies, processes and Audit and Risk Management Committee, will ensure gifts, benefits and hospitality risks are appropriately assessed and managed. Individuals with direct reports will ensure they are aware of the risks inherent in their team\u2019s work and functions and monitor the risks to which their direct reports are exposed. \nMinimum Accountabilities\nUnder the Instructions supporting the Standing Directions of the Minister for Finance 2016, the Victorian Public Sector Commission (VPSC) has set binding minimum accountabilities for the appropriate management of gifts, benefits and hospitality. These can be found at the .\nResponsibilities\nImplementation\nManagement of offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality\nThis section sets out the process for accepting, declining and recording offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality. Any exceptions to this process must have the prior written approval of the Managing Director.\n Thanks is enough\nWe encourage everyone to help develop a culture of \u2018thanks is enough\u2019. Our aim is to move to a culture in which offers are not accepted even if they are permitted under this policy. \n\nConflict of interest and reputational risks\nWhen deciding whether to accept an offer, individuals should consider if the offer could be perceived as influencing them in performing their duties or lead to reputational damage. The more valuable the offer, the more likely a conflict of interest or reputational risk exists.\n\nFigure 1. GIFT test\nThis table is a useful tool when considering how to respond to a gift offer.\nRequirement for refusing offers (Prohibited offers)\nIndividuals should consider the GIFT test in Figure 1 and the requirements below to help decide whether to refuse an offer. Individuals are to refuse offers:\nlikely to influence them, or be perceived to influence them, in the course of their duties or that raise an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest\ncould bring them, Wannon Water, or the public sector into disrepute \nmade by a person or organisation about which they will likely make or influence a decision (this also applies to processes involving grants, sponsorship, regulation, enforcement or licensing), particularly offers:\nmade by a current or prospective supplier;\nmade during a procurement or tender process by a person or organisation involved in the process\nlikely to be a bribe or inducement to make a decision or act in a particular way \nthat extend to their relatives or friends\nof money, or used in a similar way to money, or something easily converted to money\nwhere, in relation to hospitality and events, the organisation will already be sufficiently represented to meet its business needs \nwhere acceptance could be perceived as endorsement of a product or service, or acceptance would unfairly advantage the sponsor in future procurement decisions\nmade by a person or organisation with a primary purpose to lobby Ministers, Members of Parliament or public sector organisations\nmade in secret.\n\n Attempts to bribe\nIf an individual considers they have been offered a bribe or inducement, the offer must be reported to the Managing Director or their delegates who should report any criminal or corrupt conduct to Victoria Police, the Independent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission or the Victorian Ombudsman.\nIndependent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission Victoria (IBAC)\nLevel 1, North Tower, 459 Collins Street, Melbourne Victoria 3000\nGPO Box 24234, Melbourne Victoria, 3001\nInternet:   \nPhone:   1300 735 135\nEmail: see the website above for the secure email disclosure process, which also provides for anonymous disclosures.\n\nThe Victorian Ombudsman\nLevel 2, 570 Bourke Street\nMelbourne, Vic. 3000\nPhone: (03) 9613 6222\nEmail: \n\nToken offers \nA token offer is an offer of a gift, benefit or hospitality that is of inconsequential or trivial value to both the person making the offer and the recipient. It may include promotional items such as pens and notepads, and modest hospitality that would be considered a basic courtesy, such as light refreshments during a meeting. \nThe minimum accountabilities state that token offers cannot be worth more than $50. \n\nNon-token offers\nIndividuals can only accept non-token offers if they have a legitimate business benefit. All accepted non-token offers must be approved in writing by the individual\u2019s manager or organisational delegate, recorded in the gifts, benefits and hospitality register and be consistent with the following requirements:\nit does not raise an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest or have the potential to bring the individual, Wannon Water, or the public sector into disrepute; and\nthere is a legitimate business reason for acceptance. It is offered in the course of the individual\u2019s official duties, relates to the individual\u2019s responsibilities and has a benefit to the organisation, public sector or the State.\nIndividuals may be offered a gift or hospitality where there is no opportunity to seek written approval from their manager prior to accepting. For example, they may be offered a wrapped gift that they later identify as being a non-token gift. In these cases, the individual must seek approval from their manager within five business days.\nWhere the gift would likely bring you or the organisation into disrepute, the organisation should return the gift. If it represents a conflict of interest for you, the organisation should either return the gift or transfer ownership to the organisation to mitigate this risk.\n\nRecording non-token offers of gifts, benefits and hospitality\nAll non-token offers, whether accepted or declined, must be recorded in the gifts, benefits and hospitality register. The business reason for accepting the non-token offer must be recorded in the register using the  with sufficient detail to link the acceptance to the individual\u2019s work functions and benefit to Wannon Water, public sector or State. \nIndividuals should consider the following examples of acceptable and unacceptable levels of detail to be included in the register when recording the business reason:\nUnacceptable\n\u201cNetworking\u201d\n\u201cMaintaining stakeholder relationships\u201d\nAcceptable\n\u201cIndividual is responsible for evaluating and reporting on the outcomes of Wannon Water\u2019s sponsorship of Event A. Individual attended Event A in an official capacity and reported back to the Wannon Water on the event.\u201d \n\u201cIndividual presented to a visiting international delegation. The delegation presented the individual with a cultural item worth an estimated $200. Declining the gift would have caused offence. The gift was accepted on behalf of Wannon Water\u201d.\nAccess to the register is restricted to relevant persons within the Wannon Water.\nWannon Water\u2019s Audit and Risk Management Committee will receive a report at least annually on the administration and quality control of the gifts, benefits and hospitality policy, processes and register. The report will include analysis of Wannon Water\u2019s gifts, benefits and hospitality risks (including multiple offers from the same source and offers from business associates), risk mitigation measures and any proposed improvements.\nThe public register will contain a subset of the information detailed in Wannon Water\u2019s internal register, in accordance with Victorian Public Sector Commission guidance. \n\nOwnership of gifts offered to individuals\nNon-token gifts with a legitimate business benefit that have been accepted by an individual for their work or contribution may be retained by the individual where the gift is not likely to bring them or Wannon Water into disrepute, and where their manager or organisational delegate has provided written approval. Employees must transfer official gifts or any gift of cultural significance or significant value to Wannon Water. \n\nRepeat offers\nReceiving multiple offers (token or non-token) from the same person or organisation can generate a stronger perception that the person or organisation could influence you. Individuals should refuse repeat offers from the same source if they create a conflict of interest or may lead to reputational damage.\n\n\nCeremonial gifts\nCeremonial gifts are official gifts provided as part of the culture and practices of communities and government, within Australia or internationally. Ceremonial gifts are the property of the organisation, irrespective of value, and should be accepted by individuals on behalf of Wannon Water. The receipt of ceremonial gifts should be recorded on the Gifts, Benefits and Hospitality internal register but this information does not need to be published online (Public Register).\n\nHospitality provided by Victorian public sector organisations\nVictorian public sector organisations may provide hospitality to stakeholders, as part of their functions. When offered hospitality by a Victorian public sector organisation, individuals should consider the requirements of the minimum accountabilities.\nAccepted hospitality offered by a Victorian public sector organisation as part of official business does not need to be declared or reported, where the reason for the individual\u2019s attendance is consistent with Wannon Water\u2019s functions and objectives and with the individual\u2019s role.\n\nManagement of the provision of gifts, benefits and hospitality\nThis section sets out the requirements for providing gifts, benefits and hospitality.\nFigure 2. HOST test\n\n\nRequirements for providing gifts, benefits and hospitality\nGifts, benefits and hospitality may be provided when welcoming guests, to facilitate the development of business relationships, further public sector business outcomes and to celebrate achievements.\nWhen deciding whether to provide gifts, benefits or hospitality or the type of gift, benefit or hospitality to provide, individuals must ensure: \nany gift, benefit or hospitality is provided for a business reason that furthers the conduct of official business or other legitimate organisational goals, or promotes and supports government policy objectives and priorities;\nthat any costs are proportionate to the benefits obtained for the State, and would be considered reasonable in terms of community expectations (the \u2018HOST\u2019 test at Figure 2 is a good reminder of what to think about in making this assessment); and\nit does not raise an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest.\n\nContaining costs\nIndividuals should contain costs involved with providing gifts, benefits and hospitality wherever possible, and should comply with the financial probity and efficient use of resources guidance outlined in the Code of Conduct for Victorian Public Sector Employees, or the Code of Conduct for Directors of Public Entities. The following questions may be useful to assist individuals to decide on the type of gift, benefit or hospitality to provide:\nWill the cost of providing the gift, benefit or hospitality be proportionate to the potential benefits?\nIs an external venue necessary or does the organisation have facilities to host the event? \nIs the proposed catering or hospitality proportionate to the number of attendees?\nDoes the size of the event and number of attendees align with intended outcomes?\nIs the gift symbolic, rather than financial, in value?\nWill providing the gift, benefit or hospitality be viewed by the public as excessive?\n Alleged breaches\nIf employees may have breached this policy they should notify their manager in writing immediately. This enables assessment on how best to mitigate the risk \u2013 for example, arranging to return the gift.\n\nOur response will be fair, reasonable and proportionate. There will be a graduated approach and in some instances, no action will be taken. \n\nAny action as a result of a breach will be in line with the . If a criminal offence may have occurred, the Victorian or Federal Police may investigate and prosecute. \n\nAuthorising Officer and Organisational Delegate\nThe policy is issued under the authority of the Board and is subject to annual review.  The organisational delegate is the Managing Director.\n\nA conflict of interest resulting from the acceptance of a gift, benefit or hospitality is not always clear to those who have them. Individuals who are unsure about accepting a gift, benefit or hospitality, or the application of this policy, should ask their manager, General Manager, Managing Director or Board Secretary for advice.\nDefinitions \n\n\nGovernance\n\nDocument version history\nOnly the Board may authorise development and approval of Board policies. The policy development and approval process is coordinated and documented in the agenda and minutes of the Board. For document control purposes, the approver (Policy Owner) detailed above is the relevant employee responsible for managing the Policy on behalf of the Board.\n\n", "Gifts Benefits and Hospitality Policy - BOARD.DOCX"], ["Purpose\nThe purpose of this procedure is to clearly describe how hazards are identified, reported, assessed and controlled within Wannon water. \nScope\nThis procedure applies to all functions, sites and systems of work undertaken within Wannon Water by employees, contractors and the general public.\n\nA hazard is any object or any work practice that has the potential to cause:\n\ninjury or illness (to employees, contractors, visitors or general public), including both physical and psychosocial \nenvironmental or natural asset damage\nproblems or issues with water quality\nproperty and/or infrastructure damage or loss\ndisruption to service supply\ndamage or loss of ICT networks\nloss or damage to data (hard copy or electronic)\nunauthorised access to any facility or asset managed by Wannon Water\nenvironmental or natural asset damage, or\nan impact on product quality\nWannon Water\u2019s reputation to be compromised.\n\nThe Hazard Reporting process can also be used for identifying opportunities, including physical, procedural and system improvements. \nProcedure \u2013 Hazard Reporting Process\nThe purpose of hazard reporting is to work out the underlying causes of the hazard which will; \n\nprevent any incident that may result from the hazard\ncorrect the problem and to prevent a recurrence\nexplore opportunities to improve our processes and systems \nallow analysis of data.\n\nHazards can be identified in several ways, including Workplace inspections, Task Risk Assessment (TRA/JSA), HACCP Processes, Audit programme, day to day business activities (e.g. the use of procedures).\n\nWhere an exisiting process, i.e., Workplace Inspections, TRA, audit etc., results in a hazard being identified, raised and actioned, there is no need to log an additional hazard. The system can be used where beneficial but is not required. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an overview of the process for hazard reporting;\n\n\nHazard Identification and Reporting \nIt is the responsibiltiy of all employees to report any hazards they come across. All identified hazards should be reported as soon as practicable into RiskWare. Guide on how to report a hazard can be found in Content Manager; .\n\nThe person who will own/manage the hazard should be consulted as part of the process to ensure they understand the details of the issue and are the correct person to manage it.  \n\nHazard Assessment \nAll reported hazards need to be assessed in RiskWare. Our target is to complete a hazard assessment within 30 days of the hazard being reported. \n\nThe hazard assessment includes assessing what action has already been taken, what the risk is at the time of the hazard being reported, control measures required and what the risk is/will be after controls have been implemented. Guidance is available on how to complete this in RiskWare (). \n\nRisk Rating \nHazards are assessed against our operational risk consequence categories and risk matrix (). These are programmed into RiskWare and can also be found in so:control. This step involves:\n\nDetermining the likelihood that an incident will occur\nDetermining the consequences of the incident\nCalculating the risk score (which may range from low to extreme)\n\nImplementing Control Measures \nAll hazards must be managed as per our Risk Appetite using the following hierarchy of control, as far as reasonably practicable. \n\nThe hierarchy of controls has five levels of actions to reduce or remove hazards and the levels are ranked from highest level of protection and reliability through to lowest. Elimination is the most effective control measure and should always be used where possible. If it is not possible to eliminate the hazard, then you must eliminate as many of the risks associated with the hazard as possible.\n\nAdministrative and PPE controls are less effective and reliable controls. These should only be used: \nas last resorts when there are no other practical control measures available\nas an interim measure until introducing a more effective way of controlling the risk\nto increase the effectiveness of higher-level control measures\nin addition to other controls \n\n\n\nCommunication of Hazards \nIt\u2019s important that we always share information about hazards with other people where it might affect them. This is to ensure other areas can understand and apply any outcomes or learnings where applicable hazards may exist. Hazards/learnings can be communicated in a number of ways, inlcuding: \n\nOHS Representatives / OHS Consultative Committee \nSafety or Zero Harm Alerts \nTeam/Toolbox meetings \nWatershed post, emails etc. \nMonitor and Review\nAfter implementing a control measure, it should never be assumed that the control measure is effective. New control measures may also introduce hazards of their own.\n\nFor this reason, all hazards and controls should be assessed on an ongoing basis.\n\nRoles and responsibilities\nDefinitions \nGovernance\n\nDocument version history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Hazard Reporting Procedure.DOCX"], ["Purpose\nThe purpose of this procedure is to describe how incidents are to be reported, assessed for consequence, investigated and actioned.\nAn incident is an unintended event that disturbs normal operations. This event has resulted in or has the potential to result in adverse consequences to persons, the environment, drinking water quality or a combination of these; this also includes any significant deviation from an agreement, process or procedure.\nHaving an effective incident reporting and response process enables us to meet our legislative and performance obligations but also to ensure that we can learn from previous incidents and where appropriate identify controls to prevent reoccurrence.\nWannon Water is exposed to numerous different incidents of varying severity levels ranging from incidents that can be managed at a local level (e.g., site) to incidents that could involve a statewide response.\nScope\n\nThis procedure applies to all incidents, confirmed complaints and near misses including:\nSafety, health(well-being), environmental and water quality\nProcess safety (plant, equipment \u2013 integrity and damage)\nFinancial Loss (theft, fraud)\nNon-compliance with legal or regulatory obligations\nCommunity, social and reputational\nExternal stakeholder complaints\nSecurity (including cyber security).\n\nIt covers all functions, sites and systems of work undertaken within Wannon Water by employees, contractors and the general public.\n\nAll incidents are to be investigated, to the extent necessary, to determine the contributing factors and root causes.

Upon the identification of an incident, the persons responding shall ensure that the scene is made safe and (if relevant) by controlling and containing the hazard (for example-substance spill). The relevant site emergency response plan is to be initiated for initial incident management in the event of an emergency.  \n\nFirst Aid\n\nIndividuals first on the scene of an incident involving an injury must, as far as reasonably practicable and trained to do so should provide first aid and call for assistance.\n\nIs An Emergency Response Required?\n\nDoes the situation constitute an emergency? An emergency response must be called if someone is seriously hurt, people are at immediate risk, or plant is endangered. \n\nThese contact details, the responsibilities of the caller, and the duties of the emergency response team are to be located in site-specific Emergency Response Plan or the Emergency Management plan or other response plans. \n\nSecuring the site \n\nFollowing an incident, the supervisor, team leader, senior person, or emergency response person should:\n\n\u2022\tInitiate the site Emergency Response Plan as required\n\u2022\tWhere safe to do so, make the area safe and prevent escalation of the situation\n\u2022\tEvacuate people as necessary\n\u2022\tIf trained provide the necessary first-aid and medical care to the injured, account for all people\n\u2022\tPreserve the incident scene in a manner consistent with their responsibility to retain valuable information for the incident investigation. \n\u2022\tNotify management as required.\n\n\nShould Related Works be suspended?\n \t\nThe decision to suspend works associated with the incident is the immediate responsibility of the Job Owner/Supervisor. The Job Owner/Supervisor must suspend works if: \n\n\u2022\ta serious injury or fatality has occurred \n\u2022\ta reportable event occurs as defined in law (see Appendix 1) \n\u2022\tthe continuation of work may jeopardise the incident investigation.\n\n\u2003\n3.2\tReporting\n\nWhat Must Be Reported? \n\nAny and all of the following events must be reported in Wannon Water\u2019s Incident Reporting system: \n\nincidents resulting in injury \nnear miss \ndrinking water quality event exceeding the appropriate regulatory limit\nenvironmental incidents \nbreaches of trade waste agreements\nevent(s) that may impact on plant and equipment integrity (e.g. Cyber related attacks Data \nBreach, loss of cardax card, Third Party Data Breach, Ransomware, Phishing, System Compromise, Denial of Service (DOS)\nnon-compliance with procedures, and legal or regulatory obligations \nevent(s) that may adversely impact on the community, or our reputation \ntheft or similar misconduct \nsecurity breach\nexternal stakeholder complaints that are deemed to involve abuse, harassment or incivility and impact on the health & wellbeing of our employees\n\nWho Must Report? \t\n\nThe responsibility to report events rests with us all. In practice, any person who knows of an event must take reasonable steps to verify that the event has been reported to the relevant line manager. To knowingly fail to report an event is regarded as a serious failure to fulfil one\u2019s duty of care and may result in disciplinary action. \n\nVerbal Reporting to Line Management \n\nWhilst the workflow within the incident reporting system will issue emails to your Line Manager \u2013 It is good practice to also verbally notify your Line Manager or Branch Manager when an incident occurs.\n\n \nLessons Learnt\n\nThe Investigation lead is responsible for ensuring any lessons identified are shared with relevant teams and departments. \nThe approval to share externally should come from the Investigation lead.\n\n\n\nResponse \nDetermining Incident Category, Response and Type of Investigation - Table 1\n. \nNote: If the incident is a notifiable incident, the Manager Safety, Risk and Resilience must ensure that Wannon Water\u2019s Legal Services team is informed to ensure that any requirement to maintain legal professional privilege is identified and considered\nDepartment of Health and or EPA notifiable incidents will be led by Branch Manager Operations or Delegate \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoles and responsibilities\nSpecify actions and responsibilities for particular positions to ensure that the policy aligns with relevant legislation, is implemented and monitored and is reviewed to evaluate its continuing effectiveness.\n\n\nDefinitions \n\nGovernance\n\n\n\n\nDocument version history\n\n", "Incident Reporting and Response Procedure.DOCX"], ["PURPOSE\nTo outline the procedure covering the security of Information Technology (IT) systems at Wannon Water.\n\nThe IT security model is designed to protect the information systems and information assets operated by Wannon Water by restricting access to authorised personnel and by adopting industry security best practices and standards.\n\nWherever technically possible, Wannon Water systems will reflect the security guidelines set out in both the Victorian Protective Data Security Standards and the Australian Cyber Security Centre\u2019s Essential 8 Cyber Security Controls.\n\nOther relevant standards and industry practices may be applied as required.\n\n\nSCOPE\nThis procedure is divided into the following sections: \n\nNetwork security\nSystem security\nEquipment Security\nInformation and Data Security\nOther Security issues\n\nThe procedure covers the security practices which must be applied when using all IT systems.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS \nNetwork Security\nNew employees\nFollowing a request from the People and Resilience team, access to the Wannon Water computer network is granted to a new employee by the IT Team.   A new Active Directory account (e.g. john.smith@wannonwater.com.au) and temporary password is created for the employee.  \n\nAll new employees will receive an IT induction on commencement.  This induction will include an Information Technology and Systems security component.  During this induction the employee will be shown how to change the temporary password to a private, secure password.  The procedure for network password creation and management can be found in the Password Procedure.\n\nTypically, new employees will not be provided access to any part of Wannon Water\u2019s IT/ IS systems until they complete this induction.\n\nTerminating employees\nUpon the termination of an employee, the People and Resilience Team will immediately notify the IT Team, who will immediately disable the employee\u2019s Active Directory account and notify system owners of any non - Active Directory integrated systems to disable the employees access.\n\n\nConfidentiality of usernames and passwords\nUser Names and passwords are confidential.  As such, they must not be communicated to any other person (internal or external to Wannon Water.  They must not be written down.  \nUsers other than IT team members must never knowingly login to a system as another user.\n\nForgotten passwords\nIf forgotten, passwords can be reset by contacting the IT Team (see the Password Procedure for details).\n\nSharing computers\nEmployees must not use a computer that another employee is currently logged on to.  If the use of a computer is required, then the previous user must first be logged off.  The system \"assumes\" that the person at the keyboard is the owner of the User Name.  All session activity will be logged against that User Name and the owner will be responsible for any breaches of security.\nThis includes connecting to Citrix sessions from a terminal, laptop or tablet device under any credentials other than the connecting users own credentials.\n\nUse of non Wannon Water issued computers\nAccess to the Wannon Water computer network must only be through authorised Wannon Water equipment and procedures unless otherwise approved by the Information Technology Operations Manager.\nNote that this does not include publically published web services specifically provided for third party use, not does it include approved contractors using their own equipment to remotely access Wannon Water resources.\n\nIn rare instances particular items of equipment not purchased or supported by Wannon Water may be \u201cauthorised\u201d for use with Wannon Water information Systems, typically for brief and specific periods of use.  Examples of this include laptop or customised network devices used by consultants during maintenance or commissioning of assets.  In such instance the use of external equipment must be authorised by the Information Technology Operations Manager, or in the case of OT consultants, the Operations Digital Product Line Manager.\n\nNote that consultants may connect devices to the pre-secured \u201cguest\u201d WiFi network provided at Wannon Water sites.  \n\n\n\n\nAccessing Third Party computer networks or systems\nIt is not permitted to access a Third Party network or system using Wannon Water equipment, other than to allow access to Wannon Water services \u2013 i.e.connecting to home wifi or hotel wifi to allow access to Wannon Water\u2019s published systems.\n\n\nAccessing the Internet\nAccessing the Internet must be done using an approved method. For more information on authorised Internet use, see the Internet Usage Procedure.\n\nThird Party access to the Wannon Water network\nThird Party access to the Wannon Water network must follow the Remote Access (Third Parties) Procedure.\n Please refer to Remote access for third parties procedure for more detail.\n\n\n\nSystem Security\nAll systems (e.g. Finance One, Aquarate, Conquest, Fulcrum, Records Manager, Clear SCADA, etc\u2026) have an information system administrator and associated information asset steward Note in some instances the same officer fills both the roles of information system administrator and information asset steward.\n As per the Information Access Procedure, information asset stewards are accountable for ensuring appropriate access is granted to end users.  \nInformation system administrators are responsible for implementing and maintaining security access as approved by information asset stewards. \n\nSecurity access to systems will be routinely reviewed. \n\nSystem User Name and password maintenance\n\nWhere no direct Active Directory integration exists, the information system administrator is responsible for establishing new User Names for the relevant application, and setting standard passwords.  It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to reset the standard password to one that only they know.  Assistance with this process can be provided by the information system administrator.\nThe information system administrator is responsible for maintaining User Names for the relevant application under the authorisation of the relevant information asset steward.  Requests for enhanced system privileges must be made to the information asset steward, and will be implemented by the appropriate system administrator(s).\nMulti Factor authentication\nWhere ever possible, and particularly for externally facing systems, multi factor authentication (i.e. a second form of authentication) will be used.\nThe particular MFA method used by a specific information system can be either passive (i.e. a registered signed certificate) or active (i.e. a challenge \u2013 response mechanism) and will be determined by the Information Technology Operations Manager.\nNote that a challenge \u2013 response method is preferred for any external facing information system.\n\n\n\nEquipment Security\n\nLocking the computer\nWhen an employee leaves their desk for any period of time, it is important that they lock the computer (Press and hold the Window \u201cStart\u201d button and then press \u201cL\u201d). This will also occur automatically after 10 minutes of inactivity.\nThis also applies to all non windows devices issued by Wannon Water, including tablets and smartphones.\nShutting down the computer\nWhen an employee leaves their place of work for the day, they must shut down their computer (click Start, then Shutdown, then OK). \nTablet devices and smartphones must be appropriately \u2018screen locked\u2019 when not in use.\nLaptop and tablet security\nLaptops are highly portable.  Do not leave a laptop unattended outside of a Wannon Water location (see the Portable Computer Procedure).\nIf a laptop or tablet device is left unattended in a vehicle the laptop or tablet device must be secured out of plain sight, such as underneath the seats, in the glove compartment etc.  The vehicle must also be securely parked and locked at all times when unattended.\nIf a laptop or tablet device is misplaced or believed stolen it must be reported to the IT team as soon as is practical.  Many devices can be remote located or remote wiped, greatly minimising the potential security impact of any loss.\nSmartphone or Smart Device security\nSmartphones and other smart devices are increasingly powerful tools and are increasingly used as a tool for business.  As a result, a smartphone typically contains potentially valuable business data or access to business data on it, not the least being real time email access.\nWannon Water employees issued a corporate smartphone are encouraged to maintain a high degree of awareness of their smartphone.  As with laptop and tablet devices, a smartphone is a highly desirable asset and must not be left unattended.  Smartphones must be locked at all times when not in use, and should not be connected to unsolicited public WIFI networks.\nWhen left in a vehicle, the smartphone must not be left in public view (i.e. left in the phone cradle) and the vehicle must be locked and secured if left unattended.  This includes brief stops such as in petrol stations.\nIf a smartphone or other smart device is believed lost or stolen the responsible officer must report the loss to the IT team as soon as is practically possible.  As with laptops and tablets, many smartphones or devices can be remotely located and / or wiped, significantly reducing the security risk to Wannon Water.\n\nInformation (Data) Security\nIntellectual Property\nInformation contained within any Wannon Water system is viewed as Wannon Water property. Therefore, any unauthorised copying or transmission of Information may be seen as theft and subject to the Consequences of Employee Misconduct procedure.  See the Intellectual Property Procedure.\n\n\nInformation transfer /extraction\n\nThe transfer of or extraction of any information must be approved by the appropriate information asset steward(s).  This includes the extraction of Wannon Water information or data for third party reporting uses.\n\nThe usage of privately owned data storage devices within Wannon Water systems, to remove data or information from corporate repositories, is prohibited.  \n\n\nOther security issues \nSecurity holes or flaws\nIf employees find a possible security hole or flaw on any Wannon Water computer system or procedure, they are encouraged to immediately report it to the Information Technology team, the Information Security Manager or to their supervisor, either directly or via RiskWare.\n\nViruses\nIf employees transfer a file from a USB Memory Stick to the network (G, H drive), then this file must be scanned by the employee using the anti-virus software installed on their computer.  For assistance, please contact IT.\n\nSystem Patching\nVendors constantly release patches and system upgrades that are designed to mitigate security vulnerabilities.  These patches can range from simple, quick to apply code updates to large, complex version upgrades.\n\nIt is the responsibility of system administrators to ensure the systems they administer are patched to an appropriate security level to minimise cyber risk to Wannon Water. Note that patching of applications will typically fall under the change and configuration management framework currently being rolled out by Wannon Water. \n\nProcedure Breaches\nProcedure breaches will be reported to Wannon Water\u2019s CIO and the Cyber Resilience Working Group and can be subject to Wannon Water's Consequences of Employee Misconduct procedure. Breaches of this procedure will be recorded and managed as security incidents within RiskWare, Wannon Water\u2019s incident management tool.\n\nExclusions\nOn the rare occasions, due to operational support requirements, the Information Technology or Operational Technology team may be required to use a system logged in as another user. \n\nFrom time to time it may also be necessary for a system administrator or information asset steward to login to a discrete system as a system user.  These instances should be kept to a minimum and be used purely for system testing and troubleshooting and never for operational use.\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\nThe CIO is accountable for this procedure.\nThe Information Security Manager is responsible for maintaining this procedure and making employees aware of any changes to it.\nThe Information Technology Operations Manager is responsible for the application of this procedure\n\nAnyone with access to the Wannon Water computer network is responsible for abiding by this procedure.\n\nAs part of the Wannon Water induction program, employees will be required to sign a document, indicating that they have read, understood and will abide by the requirements of this procedure.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nInformation Technology (IT) team \nThe Information Technology team is contactable on extension 6777.\n\n\nSystem administrators\nA system administrator or owner is a Wannon Water officer with responsibility for the management of a particular system.  Such management typically includes day to day system support and operational performance management, and in some cases system upgrades.\n\nTypically system administrators have higher security access levels than operational users to those systems.\n\nA system administrators authority will typically only extend to the discreet application they manage, in some cases however certain systems may be linked, meaning a system administrator may have higher security access to a number of systems, or a number of system administrators may have overlapping access to a set of systems.\n\nTypically an information system administrator will manage an information system holding or processing information assets (i.e. as \u2018infrastructure\u2019).\n\nInformation asset stewards\nAn information asset steward is an officer assigned by the information asset owner to be responsible for managing the information asset on a day to day basis. The Information Steward guides how the information is managed, protected and used on behalf of the owner and defines and enforces rules for the information asset.\n\n\nWannon Water computer network\nThe Wannon Water computer network includes:\nSite Local Area Network, connecting computers and devices within a specific location,\nWide Area Network, connecting Wannon Water sites,\nRemote Access users \u2013 those mobile users connecting to Wannon Water services remotely\nCloud and SAAS services provided for users by Wannon Water.  Examples of these are the RiskWare and Azure platforms currently used by Wannon Water.\nWeb services provided by Wannon Water for end users\nAny other service published by Wannon Water to allow end user access to Wannon Water information assets.\n\nNote that for the purposes of this document the IP based carriage networks used between SCADA devices are deemed to a part of the Wannon Water computer network.  SCADA specific networks such as profibus, BacNet or ModBus connections are however excluded from this definition and deemed to be a part of the SCADA \u2018system\u2019\nUser Names and passwords\nUser Names uniquely identify user principles to information system and enable access to information assets.  \nWannon Water requires user principles to be wherever possible natural persons \u2013 shared or generic usernames are not to be used.  \nThe user principal assigned a username \u2013i.e. the \u2018person\u2019 the username is assigned to \u2013 is accountable for that username and all activity carried out under that username.\nIn the majority of cases, usernames will be generated in Active Directory and imported into other applications.\nPasswords authenticate user principals identified by a User Name against an Information system.  The default authentication method to be used by Wannon Water is a challenge \u2013 response mechanism using a password.  All usernames will have an associated password \u2013 there will be no instances of blank passwords.  All passwords must be kept confidential and adhere to the requirements of the Password Policy  Note that certain access may require the use of a second form of authentication in the form of a token or code as appropriate.\nActive Directory integration\nActive Directory integration refers to an information system drawing User Names and Passwords for an account from Active Directory.  Wherever possible Active Directory integration should be used.  This centralises the creation and administration of User Names and Passwords in Active Directory.\n\nAuthorised Wannon Water equipment and procedures\nAll equipment which has been purchased and installed by the IT Team is classified as \u201cauthorised\u201d. Refer to the computer user\u2019s procedure\n\nAll procedures that are located in SharePoint and are not in a \u2018Draft\u2019 status are classified as \u201cauthorised\u201d.\n\nExternal computer systems\nAny computer system which is not directly connected to the Wannon Water network is classified as \u201cexternal\u201d.  For example, vendors, customers, other water authorities may have a network which is classified as external.\n\nIT Systems\nThis includes the network, applications, data and all other infrastructure, including Wannon Water operated SAAS and cloud platforms.\n\nThird Party \nA Third Party is a non Wannon Water individual, group, organisation or company.  \n\nSome Third Parties are contracted to provide support to various IT systems. Depending on the business criticality of the system that they support, Third Parties will be classified as either Tier 1 suppliers or Tier 2 suppliers.\n\n\nVPDSS\nVPDSS is the Victorian Protective Data Security Standards, a Victorian Government  information security standard published by the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner that Wannon Water and other Victorian Government agencies must comply with.  More details on the VPDSS can be found at https://ovic.vic.gov.au/data-protection/standards/\nACSC Essential 8 \nThe Australian Cyber Security Centre\u2019s essential 8 is a set of 8 baseline cyber security and risk mitigation controls published by the Australian Cyber Security Centre  Australia\u2019s civilian cyber security agency.  Adoption of these controls are highly advised by the VPDSS and are a widely accepted fundamental platform for robust Cyber Security under the recent national cyber security policy .

It also highlights how the fleet is to be used and managed.\nProcedure\nPrerequisites for Permanent Mobile Allocation\nGeneral Allocation Guidelines\nThe following positions will be permanently allocated a mobile phone:\n\nManager\nFull time Operations employees\nAny office-based employee who may be required to regularly undertake duties outside the office environment\n\nThe decision as to whether a particular position requires the allocation of a mobile phone will be made by the manager responsible for the position, providing the prerequisites as outlined above have been met.\n\nSmart Phone (iPhone or equivalent) Allocation\nSmartphones (iPhones) are the default, standard mobile phone to be issued to all employees working in positions listed in section 3.1.1.\n\nResponsibilities of Permanent Mobile Phone Allocation\nPhysical Allocation\nThe mobile phone is the responsibility of the employee to whom it is allocated.\n\nThis employee shall take all reasonable measures to protect the phone from damage, loss, misuse and theft.\nSmart Phone (iPhone)\n\nFor smart phones (iPhones), employees must use the protective case at all times where allocated.  A full protective case will be allocated where the user spends considerable time in an environment potentially hostile to the phone.\n\nThis full protective case will provide the phone with resistance to water infiltration, dust and impact.\n\nUser Guide (as packaged with the phone)\nUpon receipt of a new mobile phone, it is strongly recommended that the employee familiarise themselves with the phone\u2019s features by reading the accompanying user guide.\n\n\n\nTraining\nUpon receipt of a new iPhone, the employee will receive training from an IT team member.\n\nCharging\nCharging the phone should only be done using the charger provided.\n\nShould an employee lose, misplace or damage a charger they must report the loss and organise a replacement via the IT team. All replacement chargers, including vehicle chargers, must be provided by the IT team. Employees are advised to immediately cease using any charger they notice is damaged in any way to prevent possible damage to the phone and any potential injury or hazard.\n\nPreventing Theft\nMobile phones are often the target of theft. Please store the phone securely at all times and, if left in an unattended vehicle, ensure it is hidden from view, with the vehicle locked.\n\nBreakage or Loss of a Mobile Phone\nIf a mobile phone is damaged or lost (including by theft), then the employee is required to inform the IT team, who will place a block on the phone.\n\nFollowing this, the employee must raise an incident in RiskWare using the .   The incident details must include:\n\nInformation about how the phone was lost or broken (i.e., how the protective equipment failed)\nSuggestions to reduce the likelihood of this happening again\n\nTo request a replacement phone, the incident must be submitted to the IT team. The IT team will then organise a replacement phone.\n\nNo replacement phone will be issued without a corresponding RiskWare incident being raised, including the completion of the incident form.\n\nPersonal Use\nWannon Water shall provide employees with a mobile telephone where a business need has been identified for the purpose of carrying out their duties (described in section 3.1.1). \n\nWannon Water considers that reasonable call and SMS costs made whilst employees are undertaking their Wannon Water duties, inclusive of travelling on Wannon Water business, to remain in contact with their immediate family, as acceptable use of the mobile telephone provided to the employee.\n\nWannon Water also acknowledges that making personal calls and sending personal SMS messages are necessary from time to time and directs employees to keep these activities to a minimum. \n\nEmployees are responsible for any personal phone contact numbers stored on their Wannon Water issued mobile phone. In the event of repair or maintenance activity, it is possible that such personal contact numbers may be lost. The IT team shall endeavour to keep such data intact, but it also accepts no responsibility for any losses or corruption.\n\nEmployees are also advised not to store personal data such as, but not limited to, personal photos on the phone.\n\nThe employee may take the phone home.\n\nThe installation and use of apps for personal purposes should be kept to a minimum. The installation and use of apps should take into account the .\n\nBilling\nEach month the following shall happen:\nAn IT Officer shall provide Managers with a detailed breakdown of actual costs incurred by a mobile service during the month where an issue is potentially detected i.e., extraneous charges such as mobile data.\nThe Manager shall then ascertain information from the employee concerned and advise the Branch Manager People and Resilience where an issue that is detected requires resolution under the  procedure.\n\nWannon Water reserves the right to conduct ad hoc audits of all mobile telephone services billed to Wannon Water and generate reports detailing, but not limited to, the following:\n\nCalls made outside of business hours when an employee is not on standby or on call.\nCalls with a duration of longer than five (5) minutes.\nCalls to interstate numbers.\nCalls with a cost exceeding five (5) dollars.\nLarge number of SMS text messages for the period.\nData download costs to the mobile service for the month.\nCharges or fees for any activity not considered reasonable for the operation of the employee\u2019s role. \n\nUse of Mobile Phones in Vehicles\nPrecautionary Principle\n\nThe use of a mobile phone when in control of a vehicle elevates the risk of a serious motor vehicle incident. There are laws that control the use of a mobile phone by a driver. Wannon Water also makes rules above and beyond the law to provide additional safety.\n\nWannon Water urges drivers to comply with the law and rules, and also urges drivers to be cautious and risk aware. \n\nFor further information refer to:     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Road Safety Rules (Law)\n\nThe Victoria law is specified in Section 300 Use of Mobile Phones of the Victorian ,  which is amended with .\n\nA summary of the above section in relation to mobile phone use by a driver of a vehicle is as follows: \nLearner and probationary drivers are not permitted to use a mobile phone at all while driving.\nTexting, email, video calls or such communication are not permitted.\nA driver may make and receive a phone call, perform an audio function, or use the mobile phone as a navigational aid while driving provided the phone is secured in a mounting affixed to the vehicle which is commercially designed, manufactured and installed according to manufacturer instructions. \nA driver may use an un-affixed mobile phone while driving, to make and receive a phone call, perform an audio function, or use the phone as a navigational aid as long as they do not touch the phone in any way (\u201ctouching the phone\u201d includes resting the phone on the driver\u2019s lap).\nA driver is deemed to be \u201cdriving\u201d even when the vehicle is stationary. The driver is deemed to be no longer \u201cdriving\u201d when the vehicle is pulled off the road and parked safely. There are other laws that may be applied by the Police such as dangerous driving laws. \n\n Victoria Police Advice\n\nThe Victoria Police are responsible for administering the Victorian Road Safety Rules. The Victoria Police advises the following on its web site:\n\n\u201cUsing a mobile phone whilst driving distracts your attention from the road and prevents you from maintaining proper control of your vehicle. Due to this, using a hand-held mobile phone whilst driving is illegal and attracts a significant fine and three demerit points.\n\nYou do not need to be talking on the phone to be breaking the law. Whilst driving, it is illegal to:\n\nTalk\nSend or receive text messages\nPlay phone-based games\nTake photos.\n\nIt is also illegal to perform these activities when your vehicle is stopped but not parked, such as when waiting at traffic lights. If your phone rings or you need to send a message while driving, pull over and park safely and legally before answering it.\n\nIt is illegal to use a hands-free phone whilst driving if it causes you to lose proper control of your vehicle. The penalty is a significant fine and demerit points.\n\nAlthough a hands-free device can reduce the physical effort to make and receive calls, it does not necessarily make phone use safer while driving. Consider the following suggestions if you must talk on a hands-free phone whilst driving:\n\nMake sure the hands-free function is set up and working before you start driving.\nKeep conversations short.\nDo not engage in complex or emotional conversations.\nExplain to your caller that you are driving and arrange a better time to speak with them.\nIf it is distracting you from driving, end the call.\u201d\n\nWannon Water\u2019s Position\n\nA driver of a Wannon Water vehicle must comply with relevant road laws in relation to using a mobile phone and comply with the Victoria Police Advice set out above.\n\nIt is recommended that a driver of a Wannon Water vehicle pull over and park the vehicle in a safe location to initiate, receive or engage in a phone call, because this is the safest method to communicate.\n\nWhere a driver has identified and considered the relevant risks and has considered it to be legal and safe to make or receive a phone call when driving, it is recommended that they:\nDial phone numbers through the utilisation of a voice recognition feature (if available).\nAnswer phone calls using the mobile phone\u2019s auto answer feature (if available).\nKeep the conversation short.\n\nVoice Mail\nThe voice mail message function is provided and should be used. A message should be recorded to answer any calls. \n\nThis message should be based on the following scripts.\n\nGeneral voicemail message:\n\u00a0\n\"Hi, you\u2019ve reached [first name, last name]. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.\"\n\nVoicemail when on leave:\n\u00a0\nWhen on leave, update your messages on both your office and mobile phone using this script:\n\n\"Hi, you\u2019ve reached [first name, last name]. I\u2019m on leave until [expected return date]. If you need something sooner, please call [first name, last name]\u00a0on [office OR mobile phone number]. Otherwise, leave a message and I'll get back to you when I return.\"\n\u00a0\n\nUse of Cameras in Mobile Phones\nCameras in mobile phones must only be used to assist with performing the employee\u2019s job. No use of mobile phone cameras outside of this capacity is permitted.\n\nInternet\nAccessing the Internet\nThe mobile phone fleet does have access to the Internet, however this has been enabled to support the employee performing their job, and should be kept to a minimum to avoid excess data charges, and be within the guidelines of  the .\n\nInternet usage may be monitored.\n\nOffensive or Illegal Material\nEmployees are to ensure that no offensive or illegal material is accessed and/or stored on their issued mobile phone.\n\nInformation Storage and Transfer\nAs mentioned, it is permitted that mobile phones can be used to capture and internally transfer business-related images and data.\n\n\n\nInstallation of Mobile Applications or Apps\nThe installation and use of apps is permitted by employees, subject to the following conditions:\n\nUsers are to sign into the App Store with their own individual accounts, not a generic Wannon Water account. The IT Department will set up the iPhone with an Individual Wannon Water Apple ID for use on the phone. This ID will be the employee\u2019s email address and should be kept as the ID for use on the phone. \n\nWannon Water allows users to browse the App Store and choose apps that may be productive for their needs but will not link corporate purchasing to these discrete App Store accounts. \n\nUsers wishing to purchase an app directly rather than via the corporate purchasing system must pay for the app themselves. Any reimbursement for these purchases must be undertaken via the user\u2019s manager through an expense claim. Note any app purchased and deployed by any individual remains the property of Wannon Water regardless of if the cost of the app is reimbursed or not. \n\nWannon Water will monitor and deploy corporate apps to multiple handsets via Wannon Water\u2019s MDM system.\n\nThe IT team reserves the right to remove, block or prevent access to any app deemed inappropriate or in breach of procedure on any Wannon Water owned mobile device.\n\nUse of Email Services\nWhere a smartphone is used to access email, employees are reminded that the requirements of Wannon Water\u2019s  apply.  Employees are reminded to use the email facilities on smartphones for business use only. Email access will be configured via Wannon Water\u2019s MDM platform; employees will not modify, delete or add any other email services to the smartphone.\n\nEmployees are also reminded that a smartphone may cache email data. This means that data may be physically stored on the phone. Any third party accessing the phone may be able to read cached email. To prevent this, users are advised to protect the confidentiality of their PIN codes, and to physically prevent third party access to their handsets.\n\nEmployees may request the IT team for access to their Wannon Water email account on their personal mobile phone. This provision is to assist employees in their daily tasks but is not to encourage employees to work after hours.\n\nManagement of Mobile Phone Fleet\nThe IT team shall be responsible for the management of the Wannon Water\u2019s mobile phone fleet.  As such all training, purchases, replacements, repairs and disposal of mobile phones will be coordinated by the IT team.\n\nDeployment of New Mobile Phones\nThe IT team shall deploy new mobile phones with Wannon Water\u2019s contact number lists installed and will attempt to preserve the existing contact list from the old phone.\n\n\nDisposal of Old Mobile Phones\nMobile phones will be disposed of in accordance with the  procedure and the completion of the relevant section of the Asset Change eForm.  The completed Asset Change eForm will be registered in CM Folder 15/00179.\n\nTransferring Ownership of a Mobile Phone Number\nFor exiting employees, there is an option to have the ownership of their Wannon Water allocated mobile phone number transferred to the employee.  Please consult with the IT team if this is required.\n\nMobile Device Management Platform\nWannon Water deploys a Mobile Device Management (MDM) platform to remotely manage all smart devices, including smart phones. Employees are not to in any way modify any setting or remove any part of this MDM platform, including any software (\u2018App\u2019 or otherwise) deployed onto the mobile phone by the MDM platform.\n\nChoice of Phone Model and Payment Plan /Contract\nThe IT team is responsible for the choice of phone model and payment plan or contract.\n\nInternational Roaming\nNote that international roaming is only available for Branch and General Managers, upon request to the IT Team.  Written approval from their direct manager is required.\n\nInternational Calling\nThe ability to make and receive international calls is disabled as a default. Any requests for this feature to be enabled must be directed to the appropriate General Manager for written approval.\n\nSPAM SMS Messages\nRecently, some employees have received SPAM (unwanted and unrequested) SMS messages on their mobile phones.\n\nThe procedure to adopt in this instance is:\n\nReply to the message with the text STOP\nIf further messages are received, notify the IT Helpdesk on x6777\n\nCyberbullying\nIf employees believe they are being cyberbullied via SMS, they should follow the instructions outlined in the .\n\nIt is important to keep a record of all related SMS messages.

There are also risks which need to be considered.\n\nAt Wannon Water, we would like to encourage employees to experiment safely with two free versions of popular Generative AI tools \u2013 ChatGPT and CoPilot, specifically looking for productivity improvements.  \n\nScope\nThese guidelines are for all Wannon Water employees.\n\nGuidelines\nThis document provides an overview of some of the benefits and risks of these tools and guidance for their safe and effective use.\n\nIt should be read in conjunction with \n\n\n\n\nOpportunities\n\nProductivity\n\nOne of the main benefits of using text based Generative AI tools in the workplace is that they can help companies save time and money. For example, ChatGPT can be used to generate reports, emails, and other documents, which can help employees complete their work more quickly and efficiently. \neg \u201cPlease write a procedure on the safe use of chainsaws\u201d \n\nInformation Retrieval\n\nYou can ask a Generative AI tool for information about a subject (similar to the way you might use the Google search engine).\neg \u201cHow tall is the Eifel Tower\u201d\n\nTranslation\n\nIt can translate from one language into another.\neg \u201cHow do I say thanks in Chinese\u201d\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nA tool can assess whether a text message is positive, negative or neutral.\neg \nText: \"I absolutely loved the movie! The plot was engaging, the characters were well-developed, and the ending was satisfying. Highly recommend!\" Sentiment: Positive\nThis can be used to assess customer survey responses for example.\n\nScripting and coding\n\nMost Generative AI tools can assist developers by providing sample code in popular languages.\n\nSummarisation\n\nTools can summarise sections of text or even whole documents.\n\nRecommendations\n\nYou can ask a tool to provide recommendations on work-related topics such as:\nProblem solving frameworks\nHow to build a positive workplace culture\nTechniques to improve time management\nCreative approaches to problem solving\netc\n\nThere\u2019s much more!  These are just some of the things that these tools can do.  They are trained on such large datasets that they will usually have a response to most requests.\n\nRisks and Limitations\nWhile generative AI tools offer immense benefits, they also pose potential risks to data security, specifically through data loss, resulting in privacy impacts for customers, loss of Intellectual Property and reputational, regulatory, and legal risks for organisations. \n\nData security and privicy considerations\n\nDo not use sensitive or confidential information in your requests.\n\nOnce entered into these tools, the information has been effectively made available to the uncontrolled environment of the internet. \n\nDo not use any information that is owned or related to Wannon Water.\n \nOnly ask general questions. \n\nAlways adhere to Wannon Water\u2019s data security and privacy procedures.\n\n\nLimitations\n\nResponses from Generative AI tools may also be limited as follows:\n\nData inaccuracy and biases\n\nGenerative AI models learn from the data they are trained on. If the data contains inaccuracies or biases, the model will learn and reproduce those inaccuracies or biases in its generated outputs. This can lead to the generation of misleading or incorrect information.  \n\nLack of emotional intelligence \n\nA Generative AI tool may misinterpret the emotional context of user input, leading to inappropriate or insensitive responses. They may also provide generic responses that do not resonate with users on an emotional level.\n  \nLimits on ability to reason\n\nReasoning helps in dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty. Without the ability to reason, generative AI tools may struggle when faced with ambiguous input or situations. This limitation can lead to inaccurate, contextually inappropriate, or nonsensical outputs, especially in real-world scenarios where information may be incomplete or ambiguous.\n\nMitigations\n\nTo address these limitations, check that the content produced has been fact checked and is accurate, current, appropriate, and sensitive.  \n\nAlso, check that the content produced is in line with relevant procedures, policies, legislation and regulations.\n\nIt is also important to acknowledge the use of Generative AI within the creation of your content and in any resulting decision making.  Generative AI can assist in making decisions \u2013 you remain the decision maker.\n\n\nEffective Usage Guidelines\n\u201cPrompting\u201d is a valuable skill in using Generative AI. It involves crafting questions or statements (prompts) in a way that guides the tool to produce desired outputs more effectively. This skill is crucial because the quality of the prompt will significantly influence the tool's response.  \n\nTo use a Generative AI tool effectively, please consider the following usage guidelines:\n\nBe clear and specific and use normal language.\n\nProvide clear and specific instructions to get more accurate and relevant responses.  \n\nPrompt in different ways.  \n\nIf the initial response is not what you are looking for, consider providing more context or rephrasing your prompt for better results.\nIf you dislike the response format, demonstrate the format you\u2019d like to see. \n\nSplit complex requests into several simpler requests.\n\nYou can have a \u201cconversation\u201d with a Generative AI tool, which comprises several sequential requests that are sometimes needed to get to an answer.  \n\neg \nRequest 1: \u201chow does ChatGPT work?\u201d\nResponse 1: <<something too technical for your needs>> \nRequest 2: \u201cplease explain this as if I were 12 years old and limit the response to 5 lines\u201d  \nResponse 2: <<something easier to understand>>\n\nPermitted tools\nWannon Water employees are currently permitted to use ChatGPT and Microsoft's CoPilot.\n\nUsing ChatGPT\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that is accessible to the general public.\n\nIt can be accessed at: \n\nYou will then be prompted to create a login user account. Please use your Wannon Water email address for this.\n\nOnce you have signed on, you will see a page that looks like this:\n\n\n\nUsing CoPilot \nMicrosoft's CoPilot is a new generative AI tool that is now available for free on the Edge browser on your PC.   This version is called CoPilot with Bing Chat.\n\n\n\nFrom here CoPilot can be used in a similar way to ChatGPT - generate text, answer questions, etc. \n\n\nCoPilot will soon be available within the Microsoft Office suite of products (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Teams, SharePoint etc). When deployed at Wannon Water, you will be able to use CoPilot to perform other tasks that you currently do manually, such as document writing, email and report summarisation, minute taking in Teams and presentation generation.\n\nFurther information on this will be provided to employees in due course.\n\nNext Steps\n\nPlease experiment safely with ChatGPT and CoPilot\n\nA survey will be circulated to understand how you have been using these tools, and asking if you would like to participate in a Community of Interest which could help to drive the broader use of Generative AI in Wannon Water.\n\nAssistance\nAll enquiries for assistance with the use of these tools should be directed through the Wannon Water IT Helpdesk.\n\nOnline resources\n\n\n\n\nRoles and responsibilities\nDefinitions \n\nGovernance\n\nDocument version history\n\n\n\n\n", "Use of text based Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).DOCX"], ["Purpose\nThis procedure documents Wannon Water\u2019s standard requirements for response to an Alarm triggered by the Vehicle Safety System (VSS), also referred to as the Smartrak System.\nScope\nThis procedure applies to:\nVehicle Safety System Manager.\nVehicle Safety System Alarm Security Monitoring Centre (SMC) provider.\nAll employees and/or contractors using a Wannon Water vehicle with VSS installed.\nProcedure \nThe VSS will generate alarms when these specific events occur.\nVehicle Impact\nVehicle Rollover\nPendant Duress Button Activation\nDash Duress Button Activation\nThe alarms will be configured to automatically send alerts via several methods:\nEmail alert to pre-configured addresses.\nSMS alert to pre-configured mobile phone numbers.\nThe Smartrak application will alert all logged-in users via an audio alert and visual notification.\nIntegration to alarm SMC software.\nAlarm Monitoring and Response\nAlarms will be transmitted electronically to the SMC.

By using the vehicle, the driver and passenger consent to Wannon Water collecting and storing vehicle location information.\nIndividuals have the right to ensure any personal information that is captured by Wannon Water is accurate and securely stored in accordance with the Information Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014. Any request for access to Vehicle Safety System data is to be directed to the Vehicle Safety System Manager as described in Clause 4.\nEmployees will be informed of Vehicle Safety System during commissioning of the system and for new employees, during their induction process.\nVehicle Booking System\nThe Vehicle Safety System includes the system for booking of pool vehicles.  The system is accessed via the web link on the Watershed Intranet Page.  The instructions for booking vehicles are provided on the \u201cBooking Vehicles\u201d page of Watershed and the Vehicle Booking Procedure (to be updated).  Specific instruction is available from the Corporate Services Fleet & Facilities Coordinator.\nFob (iButton)\nEach employee will be issued with a driver Identification tag known as a \u201cFob\u201d.  The manufacturer name of the Fob is \u201ciButton\u201d.  This Fob is to be \u201cattached\u201d on at the commencement of each use of the vehicle by placing the tag next to the dash receiver.  \nRecording the driver identification fob improves the level of safety provided by the system through ensuring that an employee may be telephoned directly in the event of a working alone Duress Alarm.\nIf the vehicle has been booked using the Fleet Booking System, the driver identification will be assigned during the booking process.  This driver\u2019s information may be updated by \u201ctapping on\u201d using another Fob should the individual driving a vehicle change during use of the vehicle.\nIt is the responsibility of all Wannon Water employees to \u201ctap on\u201d with their Fob at the commencement of each use of a vehicle by placing the tag next to the dash receiver. If any employee does not \u201ctap on\u201d to the vehicle, and the vehicle has not been booked using the Fleet Booking System, the system will by default apply to the next journey, the driver identification details recorded from the last active user in that vehicle.\nAlarms\nThe Vehicle Safety System will generate alarms when specific events occur.  Alarms are event-based and configurable according to business requirements. The Project Plan and Business Case have specified the following priority alarm types:\nVehicle Crash Alarm\nVehicle Rollover Alarm\nPendant Duress Button Alarm Activation\nDash Duress Button Alarm Activation\nAn Alarm can be triggered in three ways, being:\nAutomatically, if the vehicle is involved in a collision which triggers the inbuilt sensors.\nManually by the driver by pressing the dash mounted duress button.\nManually by an employee by pressing the portable duress pendant button (which works up to a maximum of 700m away from the vehicle).\nOnce triggered, an Alarm will be transmitted electronically.  The information will have: \nThe name of the driver registered in booking system \nThe mobile phone number registered in the system for that driver\nThe most recent GPS location coordinates of the vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure to be given to SMC (Security Monitoring Center)\nUpon the receipt of an alarm, the SMC will:\n1.\tMake a single call to the vehicle driver\u2019s mobile phone number within the Australian Standards of an alarm being received (1 minute). \n2.\tIf contact is established with the driver, the SMC will take action according to the information they receive. Where an emergency service is requested, the SMC will call Triple Zero (000) within one (1) minute, nominating the requested emergency service provider; and relay all Information to that emergency service provider.  \n3.\tIf there is no answer from the driver within 5 minutes of the alarm being received, SMC will call Triple Zero (000) and nominate Victoria Police as the first responder and relay all Information to that emergency service provider.\nAlarm Types\nThe technical specifications for each alarm type are configurable in the system by the Vehicle Safety System Manager according to vendor instructions.\nVehicle Crash Alarm means the Vehicle Safety System has detected a rapid deceleration of the vehicle in space and time during a given journey. \nVehicle Rollover Alarm means the Vehicle Safety System has detected the orientation of the vehicle in relation to horizontal plain has changed beyond a pre-configured angle during a given journey. \nPendant Duress Alarm means the portable duress alarm device has been triggered manually by a user for assistance.\nDash Duress Alarm means the vehicle\u2019s dash-mounted duress alarm device has been triggered manually by a user for assistance.\nThe detailed procedure for Alarms monitoring and response is contained in the document \u201cVehicle Safety System Alarm Procedure\u201d.\nSatellite Capabilities\nThe default configuration of the system includes a Telstra 3G/NextG compatible wireless modem with antenna (internal or external depending on vehicle type).  This configuration should give effective coverage for most vehicle trips and work locations.\nWhere no Telstra 3G/NextG coverage exists, the GPS device in the vehicle will continue to record time stamped GPS location data which will upload when the vehicle returns to 3G/NextG coverage, however the Alarm will not be able to be sent to the SMC.\nThe system generates a report that details \u201cblackspots\u201d where vehicles have travelled and 3G/NextG coverage is not available.  Existing vehicle systems can be upgraded for Satellite (Iridium) capabilities where regular work occurs in a \u201cblackspot\u201d area subject to a Business Case application.  \nThere are significant additional costs, both capital and ongoing for satellite systems and as such any Business Case proposed for this upgrade is to be approved by the Vehicle Safety System Manager and relevant General Manager.\nAccess to System Information\nAll Vehicle Safety System data will be retained for a minimum of 2 years after administrative use of the records has concluded in accordance with Class 06.09.02 of the Public Record Office Standard 07/01 General Retention and Disposal Authority of Common Administrative Records.\nRequests for access to information from the Vehicle Safety System must be directed to the Vehicle Safety System Manager or a person approved by the Vehicle Safety System Manager. \nAll access to recorded Vehicle Safety System data for incident investigation will be logged.

This access is for business purposes only, and the access must be approved by the Vehicle Safety System Manager.\nAccess historical information to confirm locational and time of operational past activities such as attendance to site, attendance to customer residence and similar. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup of Alarms\nThe specific software configuration of the Alarm system will be the responsibility of the Vehicle Safety System Manager.  The specific software configuration procedure will be available as per the vendor specific documentation. \n\nThe Vehicle Safety System Manager is responsible for maintaining this Procedure and ensuring any changes to alarm monitoring services and system administration are reflected in timely revisions to this Procedure and are communicated to the designated SMC provider and all corporate vehicle/system users.\nSetting Up and Managing Geo-fences\nGeo-fencing is a feature of the Vehicle Safety System.  Using the software user interface, a geographically bounded area can be defined, and rules applied to this defined area.  A Geo-fence is a type of virtual barrier and when a fleet vehicle crosses the barrier an alert or action can be programmed. Business functions can be automated so when a vehicle location triggers a Geo-fence, an alert is sent, or reports generated. Geo-fences are used strictly for business purposes only. Geo-fences can only be setup by the Vehicle Safety System Manager, or authorised Users given approval. When setting up a new Geo-fence, or modifying an existing Geo-fence, the details will be entered into the Geo-fence Register held in the system software and maintained by the Vehicle Safety System Manager.  \nPrivate Vehicle Use and Privacy of Information\nSome employees may have special provisions within their employment agreements with Wannon Water that permit private vehicle use during certain periods.\nAs the Vehicle Safety System cannot be deactivated, employees should note that access to information can only be for authorised business purposes only and these purposes are detailed in this Procedure.  Specific concerns can be discussed with the Vehicle Safety System Manager.  Access to historical locational information for periods when the vehicle is subject to private use requires the written consent of the Privacy Officer. \nRelease of Information Externally\nAll data and their contents are the copyrighted property of Wannon Water and shall not be copied, distributed or used without the written approval of the Vehicle Safety System Manager and Privacy Officer.  All requests for release of Vehicle Safety System data externally must include a written request to the Vehicle Safety System Manager.  \nSystem Maintenance\nVehicle Log Bookkeeping\nThe Vehicle Safety System provides an electronic odometer feature.  Wannon Water will run a trial using the existing logbook method, and the electronic method with the intention of replacing manual-entry logbooks with electronic logbooks during 2015.\nScheduling Checks and Testing of System Functionality\nReporting on the current operational status and performance of the Vehicle Safety System is the responsibility of the Vehicle Safety System Manager. \nThe SmartTrack system includes automatic system health reporting and will automatically flag faulty hardware and bring this to the GPS Vehicle Safety System Manager\u2019s attention via a report.\nIf an employee becomes aware that some function of the Vehicle Safety System is not operational; the Vehicle Safety System Manager must be notified.\nVehicle Maintenance and Servicing Management\nThe Vehicle Safety System Manager is responsible for the maintenance of all the Vehicle Safety System equipment.  \nThis responsibility includes ensuring that Vehicle Safety System is operating normally at all times. Regular service inspections of the devices will ensure that they are operational with any identified faults logged and reported to the Vehicle Safety System Manager.\nThe Vehicle Safety System provides a mechanism for assisting with vehicle maintenance activities.\nThe Vehicle Safety System Manager is responsible for the administration and operation of the maintenance and servicing management function.  \nThe Vehicle Safety System provides functionality to configure different kinds of servicing options (Oil Replacement, Tyre Rotation etc.) and can be programmed to receive alerts when these items need attention.

With the increased use of newer \ntechnologies, efficiency gains are available through more equitable call back arrangements.  \n \nThree distinct types of Call Back/Call Out have been recognised:  \n \n25.1 Type A: Responding to a Phone  Call \n \nDefinition Type A : Where an employee is not required to leave the location from where they have \nanswered a call to respond to the call. For example, an employee receives a phone call (from an \nalarm  or customer) and is required to make another telephone call or access the computer system  \n \nvia a modem or broadband connection to properly respond to the initial call . \n \nFor a response to a Type A call back, an employee shall be paid a minimum of half (\u00bd) an hour work \nat appropriate overtime rates.  \n \nThe minimum payment period shall not apply when the overtime is continuous with the completion or \ncommencement of ordinary working hours, or with other planned or unplanned overtime, or occurs \nwithin the span of  hours under this agreement. The employee shall not be entitled to payment more \nthan once for the specified minimum period of time.  \n \n25.2 Type B: Call Back for Employees on  Standby  \n \nDefinition Type B: Where an employee has been  required to be on standby or available ( and will  be \nreceiving standby, or availability allowance) and receives a phone call and is subsequently required to \nleave the location from where they have answered the call to commence work. For example, an \nemployee on standby is called  in to attend to a sewer blockage.  \n \nAn External Operational/Maintenance Services Employee who is called to respond to a call back as \ndefined as Type B, shall be paid a minimum of three (3) hours of work at appropriate overtime rates.  \n \nIf the call out for an External Operational/Maintenance Services employee occurs between the hours \nof 10.00pm and 6.00am on any day, the employee shall be paid a minimum of three (3) hours of work \nat the appropriate overtime rates.  \n\nWannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020  \n \n20  \n \n \nAn Administrative/Technical/Professional Emplo yee who is called to respond to a call back as defined \nas Type B, shall be paid a minimum of one (1) hour of work at appropriate overtime rates.  \n \nThe minimum payment period shall not apply when the overtime is continuous with the completion or \ncommencement  of ordinary working hours, or with other planned or unplanned overtime, or occurs \nwithin the span of hours under this agreement. The employee shall not be entitled to payment more \nthan once for the specified minimum period of time.  \n \n25.3 Type C: Call back  for employees not on  standby  \n \nDefinition Type C: Where an employee has not been required to be on standby or available  (and \nwill not be receiving standby or availability allowance), and receives a phone call and is requested  to \nleave the location from where they have answered the  call to commence work. For example , due to \nthe nature of an after-hours incident additional staff are required and are request ed to assist from \nan authori sed employee not on standby.  \n \nAn External Operational/Maintenance Services Employee, who is called to respond to a call back as \ndefined as Type C, shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours of work at appropriate overtime rates.  \n \nAn Administrative/Technical/Professional Employee who is called to respond to a call back as defined \nas Type C, shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hour of work at appropriate overtime rates.  \n \nThis Clause shall apply only in the event of employees additional to standby personnel being required \nto attend an after -hours incident. It shall not apply where an employee on standby requests a second \nemployee on standby to respond on their behalf due to the location of the worksite and the second \nemployee agrees. The agreement between employees may be a verbal standing a greement.  \n \nThe minimum payment period shall not apply when the overtime is continuous with the completion or \ncommencement of ordinary working hours, or with other planned or unplanned overtime, or occurs \nwithin the span of hours under this agreement. The e mployee shall not be entitled to payment more \nthan once for the specified minimum period of time.  \n \n25.4 Travel  Time  \n \nFor the purposes of this Clause, time reasonably spent in travelling shall be counted as time worked.  \n \n   Safety  Break  \n \nOn any one ordinary workday, employees must delay their start time or bring forward their finishing \ntime (without loss of pay) as per the calculations in the Table below if they have responded to Type A, \nType B or Type C Call Outs (as defined in above Clause 25), or if they h ave undertaken overtime.  \n \nAgreement must be received from the employees Manager/Coordinator for an employee to bring \nforward their finishing time in lieu of delaying start time.  \n \nStart of Call Out or  \nOvertime  End of Call Out or  \nOvertime  Allow able Start Time Delay or Earlier \nFinishing Time  \non Ordinary Workday  \n(see Note below)  Time on \nPreceding  \nDay Time on \nDay Time on \nPreceding  \nDay Time on \nDay \nEnd of  \nordinary \nhours   Before \n10:00 pm   No delay in starting time or bringing \nforward finishing time.  \nAfter \n10:00 pm    Before \n5:00am  A delay to starting time must occur by the \nnumber of hours worked.  \n\nWannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020  \n \n21  \n \n \n \nAfter \n10:00pm    At or \nbeyond the \nstart of \nordinary \nhours  If work continues past the start of \nordinary hours, a break must be taken  as \nsoon as practicable by the number of \nhours worked. Any time worked after the \nstart of ordinary hours is part of the normal \nhours . \n  \n \nAfter \n5:00am    \nBefore the \nstart of \nordinary \nhours  Either (with agreement from the \nemployees Manager/Coordinator):  \n \n1. Be paid overtime for that period,  or \n2. Bring forward their finishing time by \nthe   equivalent  amount  of time \n \nNotes:  \nDelay of no more than one ordinary day hours is allowable (i.e. allowable delays do not carry over \nto the next ordinary  day).  \n \nBy agreement, this clause may be varied  to meet operational or individual need based on safety \nrequirements.  \n \n26.1 Requirement for Safety Break for Other  Reasons  \n \nOver and above the allowable delays in starting time on ordinary days, any employee may elect not to \ncommence duties, or relieve the mselves from duties, if they believe there is a safety risk to \nthemselves or others due to fatigue.  \n \nAn employee shall notify their Manager/Coordinator at the earliest opportunity of any such absence, \nand provide details of the activities that have caused the fatigue.

Applicati ons for special leave under this clause must be pre -approved by the Managing \nDirector or their delegate.  \n \nFor the approved time employees spend undertaking a voluntary emergency management activity under \nthis clause, access to the conditions of the Safety Break relating to Allowable Start Time Delay or Earlier \nFinishing Time may need to be considered.  \n \n   Dispute  Resolution  \n \n56.1 Disputes Settling  Procedure  \n \n    Resolution of Disputes and Grievances  \n \nUnless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, a dispute or grievance about a matter arising under \nthis Agreement or the National Employment Standards, other than termination of employment, must \nbe dealt with in accordance with this clause. This includes a dispute or grievance about whether an \nemployer had reaso nable grounds to refuse a request for flexible working conditions or an application \nto extend unpaid parental leave.  \n \nThis clause does not apply to any dispute on a matter or matters arising in the course of bargaining in \nrelation to a proposed workplace a greement.  \n \nThe employer or an employee covered by this agreement may choose to be represented at any stage \nby a representative, including a union representative or employer\u2019s organisation.  \n \n    Obligations  \n \nThe parties to the dispute or grievance, and the ir representatives, must genuinely attempt to resolve \nthe dispute or grievance through the processes set out in this clause and must cooperate to ensure \nthat these processes are carried out expeditiously.  \n \nWhilst a dispute or grievance is being dealt with in accordance with this clause, work must continue in \naccordance with usual practice, provided that this does not apply to an employee who has a \n\nWannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020  \n \n49  \n \nreasonable concern about an imminent risk to the employee\u2019s  health or safety, has advised the \nemployer of this concern and has not unreasonably failed to comply with a direction by the employer \nto perform other available work that is safe and appropriate for the Employee to perform.  \n \nNo person covered by the agreement will be prejudiced as to the final settlement of the dispute or \ngrievance by the continuance of work in accordance with this clause.  \n \n    Agreement  and Dispute  Settlement  Facilitation  \n \nFor the purposes of compliance with this Agreement (including compliance with this dispute settlement \nprocedure) where the chosen employee representative is another employee of the employer, the \nemployee  must be released by the employee\u2019s  employer from nor mal duties for such periods of time \nas may be reasonably necessary to enable the employee  to represent employees concerning matters \npertaining to the employment relationship including but not limited to:  \n\u2022 Investigating  the circumstances  of a dispute  or an alleged  breach  of this Agreement  or the \nNational Employment  Standards;  \n\u2022 Endeavoring to resolve a dispute arising out of the operation of the agreement  or the \nNational Employment Standards; or  \n\u2022 Participating in conciliation, arbitration or any other agreed alt ernative dispute \nresolution process.  \n \nThe release from normal duties referred to in this clause is subject to the proviso that it does not \nunduly affect the operations of the employer.  \n \n    Discussion  of Grievance  or Dispute  \n \nThe dispute or grievance must  first be discussed by the aggrieved employee(s) with the immediate \nsupervisor of the employee(s).  \n \nIf the matter is not settled, the employee(s) can require that the matter be discussed with another \nrepresentative of the employer appointed for the purpose s of this procedure.  \n \n    Internal  Process  \n \nIf any party to the dispute or grievance who is covered by the agreement refers the dispute or \ngrievance to an established internal dispute or grievance resolution process, the matter must first be \ndealt with in  accordance with that process, provided that the process is conducted in a timely manner \nand it is consistent with the following principles:  \n\u2022 The rules of natural  justice;  \n\u2022 Provide for mediation or conciliation of the  grievance;  \n\u2022 Provide that the employers will take into consideration any views on who should  conduct \nthe review;  and \n\u2022 Be conducted as quickly, and with as little formality, as a proper consideration of  the \nmatter  allows.  \n \nIf the dispute or grievance is not settled through an internal dispute or grievance resolution process, \nthe matter can be dealt with in accordance with the processes set out below.  \n \nIf the matter is not settled, either party may refer the matter to Fair Work Commission (FWC).  \n \n    Disputes  of a Collective  Character  \n \nThe parties  covered by the agreement acknowledge that disputes of a collective character concerning  more \nthan one employee may be dealt with more expeditiously by an early reference to FWC.  \n \nNo dispute of a collective character may be referred to FWC directly unless there has been a genuine \nattempt to resolve the dispute at the workplace level prior to it being referred to FWC for conciliation.  \n \n    Conciliation  \n \n\nWannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020  \n \n50  \n \nWhere a dispute or grievance is referred, a member of FWC shall do everything that appears to the \nmember to be right and proper to assist the parties to the dispute to agree on terms for the settlement \nof the dispute or grievance.  \n \nThis may include arranging:  \n\u2022 conferences  of the parties  to the dispute  or their representatives  presided  over by the \nmember;  and \n\u2022 for the parties to the dispute or their representatives to confer  among themselves \nat conferences at which the member is not  present.  \n \nConciliation before FWC shall be regarded as completed when:  \n\u2022 the parties to the dispute have reached agreement on the settlement of the \ngrievance or dispute;  or \n\u2022 the member of FWC conducting the conciliation has, either of their own motion  or after an \napplication by either party, satisfied themselves that there is no likelihood that within a \nreasonable period, further conc iliation will result in a settlement;  or \n\u2022 the parties to the dispute have informed the FWC member that there is no likelihood of \nagreement  on the settlement  of the grievance  or dispute  and the member  does  not have \nsubstantial reason to refuse to regard the conciliation proceedings as  completed.  \n \n    Arbitration  \n \nIf the dispute or grievance has not been settled when conciliation has been completed, either party \nmay request that FWC proceed to determine the dispute or grievance by arbitration.  \n \nWhere a member  of FWC has exercised conciliation powers in relation to the dispute or grievance, \nthe member shall not exercise, or take part in the exercise of, arbitration powers in relation to the \ndispute or grievance if a party objects to the member doing so.  \n \nSubject to sub -clause 56.1.9 below, the determination of FWC is binding upon the persons covered by \nthis agreement.  \n \nAn appeal lies to a Full Bench of FWC, with the leave of the Full Bench, against a determination of a \nsingle member of FWC made pursuant to  this clause.  \n \n    Conduct  of Matters  before  FWC  \n \nSubject to any agreement between the parties to the dispute in relation to a particular dispute or \ngrievance and the provisions of this clause, in dealing with a dispute or grievance through conciliation \nor arbitration, FWC may conduct the matter in accordance with Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part 5 -1 \nof the Fair Work Act 2009.  \n\nWannon Water Enterprise Agreement 2020  \n \n51  \n \n \n \n \n\nSCHEDULE A: RATES OF PAY - WANNON WATER ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT

Further information on this order can be found on the .  \n\nContact Officers\nContact Officers are appointed Wannon Water employees who are voluntarily available for employees to contact for bullying, discriminition and harassment complaints.\n\nContact Officers are provided with regular training to support their role and keep them up to date with relevant legislation, guidelines and other related information. Contact Officers are aware of the need for sensitivity and the high level of confidentiality critical to this role.\n\nThe role of the Contact Officers includes:\nFirst point of contact for all complaints\nAssist and support\nAssisting the Complainant to establish a process to stop offending behaviour\nAssistance with access to relevant information about rights and options.\nReferring the person to Wannon Water\u2019s Employee Assistance Provider.\nAssisting the Complainant to formalise a complaint for investigation.\nAct as an information resource.\nRights and responsibilities under the organisation\u2019s policy.\nRights under State and Federal equal opportunity law.\nWhat constitutes discrimination, harassment and bullying.\nThe prohibition on victimisation.\nOptions available to deal with the individuals concerns and the likely results of these.\nPresent resolution options\nProviding information about the options available to deal with the complainant\u2019s concerns and the likely results of these.\nDiscussing possible strategies the Complainant can use to deal directly with the Respondent.\nDisplay commitment to Equal Opportunity\nThe Contact Officer has a proactive and preventative role in the elimination of discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying. Their behaviour should be a positive reinforcement of appropriate behaviour and actions in the workplace.\n\n\nAny reports of bullying, harassment or discrimination will be treated seriously and sympathetically, and where required will be investigated, confidentially and objectively. Complainants and witnesses shall not be victimised in any way. \n\nAny complaint requiring investigation should be referred, in writing, via the Contact Officer or a Manager/Supervisor to the Manager People & Wellbeing or delegated to an appropriately trained individual.\n\nWhere there is a potential or perceived conflict of interest Wannon Water may engage an appropriately qualified external party to conduct any required investigation.\n\nBystanders intervention\nBystanders, including Wannon Water employees, who witness or are aware of sexual harassment can play an important role in preventing sexual harassment within the workplace. \n\nSome examples of a bystander can be:\nAn employee who sees a colleague being harassed by another employee, customer or person.\nAn employee listening to colleague, make inapprorpirate sexual comments about their collleagues at a social gathering.\nAn employee who is told by another employee that she is being sexually harassed by another employee.\nA manager who is informed about the sexual harassment of another employee.\n\nBystander action is the action people can take in response to either seeing the sexual harassment or hearing about it after it has occurred.\n\nEmployees should not take any actions that puts themselves, or someone else, in danger.\u00a0 Some safe and practical strategies employees can take if they witness sexist or sexually harassing behaviours are: \nNotice the event - Having the awareness to recognise sexual harassment.\nIntrepret - Understanding it as a problem.\nBe responsible - Feel responsible for helping in an appropriate way. Some options are:\nReport the behaviour\nCall out the behaviour and education\nCheck in with the person harassed\nDiffuse the situation.\nApply knowledge and skills - Have the necessary knowledge and skills to act appropriately.\nAct - Remembering that sometimes the \u2018acting\u2019 is as simples as listening to the person who has been sexually harassed. \nIn some situations, a witness may wish to remain anonymous and where appropriate, anonymity will be provided. However, it may not be possible in all circumstances to keep the identify of a person, or people providing information anonymous.  \n\nRights of the Complainant\nThe Complainant is the person who claims to be the subject of bullying, harassment or discrimination, and who may complain about an experience or incident.

A respondent has the right to:\nHave the complaint dealt with in a confidential and private manner, without public accusation.\nHave support and representation throughout the process.\nBe informed of what they are accused of and of who is making the complaint.\nRespond to all allegations.\nNatural justice in the procedures used to pursue and resolve a complaint.\nNot be defamed, prejudge or discriminated against, or be the subject of unfounded or vexatious complaints.\n\nWhen a report of bullying, harassment or discrimination is received, the complainant will be provided information to determine if they wish to proceed with an investigation into the complaint. \n\nAny complaint requiring investigation will be dealt with effectively, confidentially, and promptly and will be taken seriously, and investigated both impartially and thoroughly. \n\nThe investigation will incorporate these guidelines:\nThe investigation will establish the facts; and not presume events or knowledge without confirmation.\nThe investigation needs to ensure that the employee was aware that their actions were unwelcome, constituted bullying, harassment or discrimination, were in breach of this Procedure and could lead to discipline.\nProcedural fairness needs to be afforded to the complainant and the person being complained of. This includes informing the employee of any allegation.\nThe investigation and disciplinary process must be transparent and fair while being sensitive and confidential.\nAll parties will be kept informed of the process and provided with reasoning for actions that have been taken and in some circumstances not taken. \n\nIn reaching a recommendation or conclusion about any allegation, the Workplace Investigations Officer may draw on the assistance of external providers.\n\nConsequence\nWhere a complaint is substantiated and a breach of the Code of Conduct for the Victorian Public Sector Employees and the Wannon Water Code of Conduct Addendum occurs, disciplinary procedures as per Wannon Water\u2019s policy Consequences of Employee Misconduct may be applied up to and including termination of employment.\n\nReporting\nThe outcome of any investigation will be reported to the attention of the Managing Director and the relevant General Manager that:\nDescribes the allegations/what was reported.\nDescribes the investigation process.\nOutlines all relevant evidence (including who was interviewed).\nConcludes whether the allegations can or cannot be substantiated.\nOutlines any recommended actions to be taken. \n\nAfter the Investigation\nUpon the completion of a workplace harassment or discrimination investigation, communication to relevant stakeholders will occur. \n\nThe complainant will be advised of the outcome of the complaint, reasons for the findings explained and an outline of any steps that have been taken (if necessary) to prevent the behaviour from recurring.  \n\nThere will be follow-up to ensure the outcome is working satisfactorily.\n\nReportable Conduct \nWhere a report of sexual harassment is made that may involve behaviour constituting a criminal offence (e.g. sexual assault, indecent exposure, stalking, obscene communications), the Manager People and Wellbeing should immediately be contacted for advice.\n\nIn general, Wannon Water will not report sexual offences to the police without the consent of the person making the report, in line with a person-centred and trauma-informed approach. However, when there is an imminent risk to safety, there will be circumstances when police may need to be called without consent.\n\nConfidentiality, privacy and transparency\nWannon Water will treat reports of bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment confidentially, including:\nthe identity of the person impacted, the complainant and respondant, and any other person involved in the investigation process.\ninformation provided or collected during the investigation of an allegation.\n\nIt is expected that all workers involved in an investigation will keep details of the allegation confidential until the investigation has concluded. Failure to do so may result in further consequences or disciplinary action, as outlined in the Consequence of Employee Misconduct Procedure. \n\nEnsuring confidentiality should not prevent the people involved from seeking support, such as through the Employee Assistance Program or bringing a support person to meetings. People involved in an investigation are actively encouraged to seek support from providers, such as the Employee Assistance Program. \n\nSome information reported may need to be disclosed to involved parties in order to properly investigate the matter.\n\nProtection against victimisation\nWannon Water does not tolerate victimisation. \n\nVictimisation occurs when a person is subjected to or threatened to be subjected to a form of detriment, because it is known or suspected that they have lodged a grievance. Victimisation also includes theratening someone who may be involved in a grievance handling process, such as a witness or bystanders.\nRoles and responsibilities\nDefinitions \nGovernance\nDocument version history\n", "Bullying, Discrimination & Harassment Free Workplace Procedure.docx"], ["Purpose\nWe recognise that some customers may, from time-to-time, need support to pay. The support needed will vary in extent and duration depending on individual circumstances.\nOur Customer Support Policy commits us to treating all customers, regardless of their circumstances, with understanding, dignity and respect, while focussing on those who may be vulnerable to financial or other pressures impacting their ability to pay.\nScope\nThis policy has been developed for customers who are having difficulty paying.\nPolicy statement\nDefinition of customer needing support\nA customer needing support to pay is a person who does not have the financial capacity to make payments within the timeframe set out in our payment terms.\n\nSome circumstances that can lead to a customer needing support to pay include:\n\nHaving low income or being unemployed\nIllness, including mental health, or accident\nFamily separation\nFinancial abuse\nA death in the family\nSudden unexpected expenses\nImpacts of global events such as a pandemic or economic crisis.\n\nA customer may also be vulnerable due to the following circumstances:\n\nHaving a low level of literacy\nHaving a disability\nSuffering from addiction\nComing from a culturally or linguistically diverse background\nBeing an asylum seeker or refugee\nBeing affected by family violence.\n\nNot all customers may volunteer that they need support. We aim to identify customers who may need support to pay by checking the following:\n\nIf the customer is, or has been, eligible for a government-funded concession\nIf the customer has requested information about alternative payment arrangements\nIf the customer has previously successfully applied for a Utility Relief Grant\nIf the customer's payment history indicates they have previously had difficulty paying\nIf the customer indicates they have had a sudden change of circumstances that adversely affects their ability to pay\nIf the customer self-identifies as currently needing support to pay\nIf the customer has a low level of income or indicates that are not employed\nIf the customer indicates they are, or might be, experiencing family violence\nIf the customer indicates they are having difficulty meeting their minor trade waste or backflow compliance requirements\nIf the customer indicates their small business has been impacted by events that have reduced their profitability.\n\nImportantly the above list of possible indicators of customers who may need support to pay is not definitive and we will therefore consider customers in accordance with their individual circumstances. Additionally, not all customers identifying with one or more of the above checks will need assistance.\n\nIdentification of customers who may need support to pay can occur through any of the following:\n\nCustomers may self-identify as needing support to pay\nOur employees may identify a customer needing support to pay\nAn independent accredited financial counsellor may identify customers needing support to pay.\n\nRights of customers needing support\nCustomers needing support to pay will be treated with confidentiality, understanding, dignity and respect without making value judgements.\n\nEach customer needing support has the right to:\n\nBe treated with dignity and sensitively on a case-by-case basis\nHave their circumstances kept confidential\nReceive information about programs they are eligible to access, including alternative payment arrangements, government concessions and grants, and this policy\nNominate an amount they can reasonably afford to pay on a payment arrangement\nRenegotiate the amount of their payment arrangement if there is a change in their circumstances\nReceive written confirmation of any payment arrangement within 10 business days\nChoose from various payment methods\nReceive information about the free and independent services offered by local accredited financial counsellors\nReceive, at no cost to the customer, a language interpreter service\nBe exempt from water supply restriction, legal action, interest charges and additional debt recovery costs while negotiating a payment arrangement or while continuing to make payments according to the agreed schedule\nAccess water conservation information to assist in reducing consumption\nReceive information about our complaints and disputes process and information on how to lodge a complaint with the Energy and Water Ombudsman Victoria or any other relevant external dispute resolution forum in the case that we are unable to resolve their concern.\n\nCustomers identified as experiencing family violence have additional support available as set out in our Family Violence Procedure.\n\nResidential and small business customers can also access our Financial Support Procedure. This applies if the payment amount a customer can reasonably afford is not adequate to cover both arrears and future estimated water bills.\n\nAssistance options\nCustomers are entitled to a range of assistance options. We will inform customers of the different assistance options that may be right for them, and attempt to reach a mutual agreement on the best options for their specific circumstances.\n\nAssistance options may include:\n\nConcession assistance \u2013 including life support machine rebates\nCentrepay or direct debit payment options\nBonus credits for residential and small business customers \u2013 a flexible payment arrangement that provides a \u201cbonus\u201d credit of one instalment payment each time the customer meets their instalment arrangement for three consecutive payments\nPotential forgiveness of debt, interest and/or legal fees in certain circumstances \nShort-term or long-term flexible payment arrangements\nTemporary suspension of payments\nUtility Relief Grants \u2013 assistance in applying for this government-funded grant\nHigh usage and leak allowances\nAccess to water conservation information to assist in reducing consumption\nCommunity Rebate Program\n\nCredit management guidelines\nWe will consider each customer\u2019s individual circumstances and suggest a payment arrangement for an amount and period of time that we believe is appropriate and sufficient to recover debt and meet future bills.\n\nWe will ask the customer to consider the offered flexible payment arrangement and to nominate an amount they believe they can afford to pay.\n\nIf a customer nominates a payment arrangement amount that is not enough to clear their debt, we may accept that payment amount. In these situations, we will encourage ongoing communication and facilitate a longer-term engagement with the customer to continue the support process.\n\nWe will consider other options such as temporary suspension of payments, or waiver of part or all of the customer\u2019s debt depending on the circumstances.\n\nIf a customer is unable to commit to a payment plan, we will provide them with information regarding the services of a free and independent financial counsellor.\n\nCeasing customer support\nSupport offered under this policy will cease under the following circumstances:\n\nThe customer self identifies as no longer needing support\nThe customer\u2019s account has gone into credit and they are able to maintain the account with the current payment arrangement\nThe customer fails to make scheduled payments in accordance with their payment arrangement or fails to contact us and engage with our support process. Debt collection actions may be taken after due consideration of their current circumstances.\n\nOur commitments\nWe ensure our Customer Support Team members are trained to communicate sensitively with customers needing support to pay and to refer customers to internal or external support as appropriate to their individual circumstances.\n\nWe keep our knowledge up to date with industry-best practice and ensure our processes provide customers with supportive experiences.\n\nWe maintain open dialogue with the following industry bodies to ensure that the operation of our customer support program is consistent with government guidelines:\n\nEssential Services Commission\nDepartment of Families, Fairness and Housing\nEnergy and Water Ombudsman Victoria\n\nWe also work with financial counsellors, welfare agencies, other utilities and customer representative bodies to develop and improve our understanding of the complex issues confronting low income and vulnerable customers. Consistent with these commitments, Wannon Water has developed a Build Financial Inclusion Action Plan (FIAP), is a founding partner of the National Thriving Communities Partnership and has established the South West Thriving Communities Partnership Network.\n\nThe Branch Manager Retail Services has been allocated accountability for the strategic direction, operation and management of this policy and supporting procedures. Customer Relations Coordinators support the Branch Manager in delivering this accountability and all Customer Relations Team members are responsible for adhering to this policy and associated procedures.\n\nInformation\nWe invite customers to contact us to discuss the range of options available to them.

Technology and information is used to support operations, make decisions and deliver services. \nWe recognise that our systems are complex and that the global cyber threat environment is constantly evolving. As such, we cannot fully eliminate the possibility of a serious cyber incident occurring. As such we are deliberately adopting a \u201ccyber resilient\u201d approach, with the aim of quickly recovering from attacks and incidents. Our systems, infrastructure and approach to security need to be resilient in the face of increasing cyber security threats.\nOur customers expect that we will protect their personal data with reasonable security safeguards against loss or unauthorised use.\nThis policy highlights Wannon Water\u2019s commitment to protecting its data and infrastructure by complying with the Victorian Protective Data Security Standards (VPDSS) and aligning with the internationally recognised NIST 800-53 information security standard.\n\nSCOPE\nThe Wannon Water Cyber Resilience Policy applies to all employees and contractors.\n\n\nPOLICY\nWannon Water is committed to protecting its data and infrastructure from cyber threats. We also recognise that due to the complexity, growth and ubiquitous nature of the Information Technology / Operational Technology (IT/OT) infrastructure, and the ever-changing cyber threat landscape, establishing and maintaining multiple controls will not  completely eliminate the risk.  As such the adoption of a cyber resilient mindset is important.\n\nWannon Water specifically recognises that, to be a cyber resilient organisation we will:\n\ncomply with the VPDSS;\nalign with the NIST 800-53 standard ;\nmaintain a strong risk management culture with a clear view of the risk landscape;\nadopt a whole of enterprise approach, understanding that cyber resilience extends beyond the traditional realms of IT and OT, existing across all teams and all levels of the organisation and extends to physical security;\nmaintain a clear understanding of the critical information assets and operational processes which may be threatened;\ntrain all employees in cyber security concepts and relevant practices;\nregulary assess, improve, augment and test our controls;\nbe open about cyber incidents , informing affected stakeholders as soon as reasonably possible;\nbe flexible to re-orientate controls to respond to a dynamic and shifting cyber risk environment;\nrecognise that we operate in an eco-system, and the need for cyber resilience extends to our suppliers and contractors; and\nimplement this policy through a robust cyber resilience strategy.\n\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\nThe Audit and Risk Management Committee has oversight of cyber resilience and therefore this Policy.\n\nThe Chief information Officer is accountable for the implementation of this Policy.\n\nThe Information Security Manager is responsible for the implementation of this Policy. This is achieved primarily through the development and implementation of the Cyber Resilience Strategy.\n\nAll employees are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to be aware of, support and adhere to, Wannon Water\u2019s cyber security requirements and take all reasonable steps to safeguard Wannon Water\u2019s information and operational systems and assets from inappropriate or insecure use. \n\n\nDEFINITIONS\nCyber \u2013 reflects the combination of information and information systems, all things connected to them, the facilities in which they are contained and the people that interact with them.\n\nInformation Technology (IT) \u2013 computing systems that are used to control administrative operations.\n\nOperations Technology (OT) \u2013 computing systems that are used to control industrial operations.

These principles are:\n\nWannon Water creates, consumes, and holds significant amounts of raw data, from which significant information assets can be derived and identified\nThese information assets are consumed, generated and manipulated in a number of information systems owned and operated by Wannon Water\nWannon Water recognises value in our information assets and systems\nThere is interest in the consumption of our information assets by external agencies\nWannon Water is committed to protecting the Integrity, Availability and Confidentiality of our valued Information Assets\nWannon Water accepts the concept of least privilege as a core control to ensure the Integrity, Availability and Confidentiality of our information assets, and we accept access control as a primary control to do this.\nBackground and Purpose\nThis policy forms a component of Wannon Water\u2019s Cyber Resilience Strategy and is designed to provide a working framework within which to govern the provision of consumer and management access to Wannon Water\u2019s information assets.\n\nIt will cover:\n\nProvision of access\nMaintenance of access, including changes to access or access levels\nRevocation of access including voluntary or automatic rights repudiation\nPrivileges and accountability determination mechanisms\nAuthentication and Identity mechanisms to the extent they relate to access to Wannon Water\u2019s information assets.\n\nNote that the intent of this policy is also to govern access to any subset or extract of or from any Wannon Water information asset.\n\nThis document will present guidance in line with relevant Victorian and Australian Government standards including:\n\nThe Victorian Protective Data Security Framework (VPDSF)\nThe Federal Protective Security Policy Framework, specifically INFOSEC 9 \u2013 Access to Information\nAustralian Signals Directorate Information Security Manual.\n\nWhere relevant, guidance shall also be presented from other Government standards and industry best practice guides such as:\n\nStatement of Direction for the Victorian Public Service: Workforce and Access Management\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework (NIST CSF)\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-53 (r4) (NIST 800-53), in particular the Access Control (AC) control family\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-82 (NIST 800-82)\nThe Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework\nThe Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) framework.\n\nAs part of the Cyber Resilience Strategy, Wannon Water has elected to align its cyber control framework to NIST 800-53 (r4), NIST 800-53 (r4) controls and general terminology will be referenced throughout this document.\nScope and Intent\nThis policy will apply to the management of access of or to any Wannon Water information asset either in its entirety or any part of in any form, including offline extracts.\n\nThis includes all information assets identified in the Wannon Water Information Assets Register, and any other information assets not as yet identified that could reasonably be considered an Information Asset.   The intent behind this will be understood to include the following constituting components of these information assets:\n\nAny raw DATA in any format\nAny software or software system used to:\nCreate any component of the asset\nStore or manage holding of the asset or a component of the asset\nManipulate, calculate, modify, document or report on the asset\nReport on or present the asset for consumption\nAny extract of information (or raw data) from the asset, including in hardcopy.\n\nNote that it is explicitly intended to include access controls to any extracts of any information asset within the scope of this policy.  The intent of this inclusion is to ensure consistency between access management of information assets and subset and extracts of those assets.  \n\nWhile not intended as a technical document, certain technical terminology and principles will be used as appropriate throughout this document.\nApplicability and Responsibility\nThis policy will be applied to all requests for access to Wannon Water\u2019s information assets.  In practice, this means the policy will apply to:\n\nAll Wannon Water employees\nAll Wannon Water contractors, their employees and agents.  This includes contractors employed under fixed contracts, operational agreements and ad hoc arrangements\nCustomers\nVendors and suppliers\nGovernment agencies and regulators.\n\n\nResponsibility for the governance and ongoing maintenance of this policy is as follows:\n\nFigure 1: Responsibility and Accountability\n\nBreaches of Policy\nBreaches of this policy will be treated as a Cyber Incident and be investigated under the guidelines of the Wannon Water Cyber Incident Response Framework.\n\nWillful or negligent breaches of this policy may result in Wannon Water team member being sanctioned under Wannon Water\u2019s Consequence of Employee Misconduct process, at the discretion of the Chief Information Officer.\n\nIt should be noted that breaches of this procedure may result in a contravention of the Victorian Protective Data Security Standards, or other relevant regulations or legislation and may result in notification to a regulatory body such as DPC or OVIC.  In such cases external penalties may apply.\nPolicy\nGeneral Principles\nThis policy will adhere to these general principles of access management.\nRisk appetite and tolerance\nWannon Water\u2019s information assets are critical to its operations - reliable information leads to reliable business decisions, with corresponding efficiency and customer satisfaction gains.  Wannon Water has an obligation to ensure the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information assets.  A key control in ensuring the veracity of our information assets are access controls.  \n\nThe principle of least access, a widely adopted cyber control, states that users and consumers of information should only have sufficient access to ensure their role. This principle is effectively controlled by access control rules and guidelines, and will be adopted as a core principle by this policy.\nKey to assessing our access controls is the level of risk we are willing to accept (appetite) and tolerate (tolerance) to the veracity of our information. An organisation\u2019s risk appetite will clearly affect the level and complexity of controls.\n\nWannon Water currently has a low risk appetite and tolerance, so this policy will be detailed accordingly.  This policy is designed to support a low risk approach to access control.\n\nAccess Authorisation\nAll access to a Wannon Water information asset must be authorised by the appropriate Authority.  This Authority will be an individual delegate with the authority to create, modify and revoke access to a particular information asset as delegated by the owner of that information asset.  Typically within Wannon Water, this will be an Information Steward .  In some instances, the Authority may also physically grant the access permissions, but in many cases this physical provisioning will be undertaken a designated system administrator , or by the IT team.\n\nNo access rights will be granted to any Information Asset or Information System without appropriate authorisation from the relevant Authority.\n\nNote that in certain circumstances, such as during a cyber incident, the IT team, acting on the authority of the Chief Information Officer, the ISIRT, or IMT, may unilaterally provide, modify or revoke access permissions as reasonably required.\n\nInformation Asset Stewards and Information System Administrators\nAn Information Steward is an officer that has been delegated authority and responsibility for the maintenance of an information asset by that information assets owner.  The roles and responsibilities of Stewards are defined in document CD2020/00716 Information Management Custodian Model, and include maintaining the security for their designated asset.   Information Stewards will act as access Authorities for the assets they are responsible for.\n\nSystem administrators are officers who have privileged access to one or more information systems (I.e., applications) that support information Assets.  Information Stewards delegate authority to undertake system administration roles to these System Administrators.  In some cases Information Stewards may also be System Administrators, but more often than not a single System Administrator may support several Information Assets \u2013 take for instance the Finance One system.  This information system hosts multiple Information Assets, and therefore has multiple Information Stewards, but being a single digital eco system, it makes sense for it to have one System Administrator.\n\nThe System Administrators role can be thought of as the \u2018technical expert\u2019, and would typically undertake the following tasks:\n\nApply updates and patches, under the guidelines of the Wannon Water Change and Configuration Management Process\nManage user and access adds, moves and changes\nProvide day to day operational support\nProvide expert advice\nAssist in system development and upgrades\nMaintain the integrity of the information system, including data processing rules and system security.\n\nTypically there will be no more than two Information System Administrators per Information System to limit the use of privileged access accounts, and to place a degree of control over changes.  Wherever practical, privileged access (I.e. administrator level access) will be via specialised restricted administrative accounts rather than day to day accounts.\n\nTo support the concept of separation of duties, an Information System Administrator must not make any change to the access rights of any user without the authorisation of the relevant Authority.  In terms of the RACI model, the relevant roles and authority of Information System Administrators and Information Stewards in terms of access management can be summarised as below in Figure 2:\n\nFigure2: Steward and Administrator roles\n\nAccount Management\nAccount Management\nThe primary access management agent will be a user account \u2013i.e. a user account will be the agent via which an individual obtains access to an information asset.\n\nThis user account may be a global account shared across assets (i.e. an Active Directory) account, or local to a particular system (i.e. an Asana log in).  \n\nAs a general baseline, accounts will:\n\nBe unique, and whenever possible linked to a natural person, with the preferred format of <firstname.lastname>\nBe configured as a challenge \u2013 response mechanism (i.e. a password)\nBe configured to disable after a defined challenge \u2013 response failure repetition (i.e. lockout)\nBe assigned role based privileges\nBe auditable wherever possible\nBe capable of disablement wherever possible\nFor temporary accounts (i.e. contractors) be set with pre-defined usage conditions (i.e. time restricted access, asset restricted etc.) with a pre-defined account disable time \nAccounts are disabled after a defined period of inactivity\nWhere possible, Active Directory accounts will be used.  Active Directory is centrally managed and has significant security management tools built in\nWhere possible, privileged access accounts will be separated from day to day access accounts.\n\nPlease refer to the Password Procedure and the Information Technology Security Procedure for further details.\nAccount Creation Process\n\nThe creation of all accounts must be requested by the appropriate authorising Authority. This Authority will be a Wannon Water officer with appropriate authority to permit or modify access to a Wannon Water information asset, as delegated by the \u2018Owner\u2019 of that asset.  Typically this will be a designated Information Steward, or Information System Administrator.  \n\nTypically, accounts will be created by Wannon Waters\u2019 IT Team, although in some instances discrete system accounts will be created by an Information Asset Steward.\n\nAccounts (other than emergency accounts) will only be created on receipt of a request from an authorised authority. \nTemporary Accounts\n\nTemporary accounts will be created for time limited engagements (i.e. contractors or fixed term employment). As with standard accounts, all temporary accounts must be authorised by the appropriate Authority. Any temporary accounts will be created with the following attributes:\n\nMinimal access privileges designed to achieve the required works\nAppropriate asset or time based access controls, as appropriate.  For instance an account may be created for a contractor allowing only access to a specific asset during specified hours of the day, connecting from a specified location\nBe regularly audited\nBe identifiable as a temporary account (i.e. metadata labelled, created in a special system container for temporary accounts)\nBe automatically time expired where possible.  For instance a contractor\u2019s account may be set to automatically disable on the due date of completion of their engagement.\nEmergency Accounts\n\nFrom time to time it may become necessary to create emergency accounts in a system.  Emergency accounts will typically have a significantly higher level of access privileges than standard accounts and are typically required urgently, in response to an exigent circumstance.  In such instances, the standard account and access enablement processes may be inappropriate. \n\nEmergency accounts are not intended for permanent use and are considered to be very short term in duration, created to assist resolution of a specific issue.\n\nAn emergency account must be authorised by one of the following officers:\nThe Chief Information Officer\nThe IT Operations Manager\nThe Manager Electrical and Mechanical Services\nThe ISIRT\nThe Incident Controller of a duly formed IMT\nInformation Security Manager.\nAn emergency account must only be created during exigent circumstances where it is obvious the standard account creation process is inappropriate or can\u2019t be followed.  \n\nAll emergency accounts must be disabled on resolution of the circumstances that caused their creation.\nAccount Revocation\nAll accounts will be suspended on notification from the appropriate Authority of a request to suspend an account.  Accounts can be either temporarily suspended, or permanently suspended.\nTemporary Suspension\n\nAn account may be temporarily suspended when an account principle (I.e. the \u2018holder\u2019 of the account) is unable to \u2018access\u2019 the account for an extended period of time, for instance on extended medical leave, or a contractor ending their period of engagement but with an expectation of being awarded further works in future.\n\nNote that a suspended account does not have its access rights revoked, but merely suspended \u2013 on reactivation, the account retains all of its pre- suspension access rights.\n\nNote that in certain circumstances, the suspension of an account may not be appropriate \u2013 for instance a team member going on extended long service leave who still requires access to email.  Suspending their account will disable this access completely, so in these cases it is more appropriate to revoke access rights to all but the minimum information assets needed under these circumstances.\nPermanent Suspension\n\nThere will be circumstances where an account needs to be permanently suspended or disabled, examples of such may be a team member leaving Wannon Water, a contractor completing their engagement with no immediate further engagement planned.  In most circumstances it may not be desirable to immediately revoke (i.e. delete) that account, but to disable it with no intention of reactivation under normal operating circumstances.\n\nAccounts permanently suspended will be reviewed every six (6) months through the Authorised Access Review process (refer to ref CD2020/00718) and if no longer required, revoked (i.e. deleted or archived).\nEmergency Revocation\nAccounts (and access) may be revoked by the IT team in an \u2018emergency\u2019 situation without consultation if required and as directed by the:\n\nChief Information Officer\nInformation Security Manager\nInformation Technology Operations Manager\nInformation Security Incident Response Team\nIncident Response Team\nNotification from either Victorian Government Cyber Security Unit, DEWLP or OVIC.  \n\nTypically an \u2018emergency\u2019 situation would be:\n\nAn active cyber incident within Wannon Water\nAn active cyber incident impacting a supplier or contractor\nAn active cyber incident impacting Australian or Victorian government\nSuspicious account activity leading rise to concerns of compromise.\n\nAccess suspended during such an \u2018emergency\u2019 event will in general be restored at the conclusion of the \u2018emergency\u2019 event, following the appropriate investigation.\n\nPrivleged Account Management\nWherever possible privileged accounts, that is, accounts with a level of administrative privilege, will be separate to day to day accounts.\n\nAll privileged accounts will be wherever technically possible, secured by MFA.\n\nAuthentication\nAll access accounts will enforce authentication.  That is, the access account itself will enforce some form of challenge \u2013 response authentication to confirm the veracity of the access account credentials.  This authentication will comprise an encrypted password and where possible, a form of multi factor authentication.  \n\nWherever possible, information systems will employ Active Directory authentication and MFA, particularly where the application is:\n\na)\tPublic facing\nb)\tSaaS or public cloud based\nc)\tStores or manipulates information assets of a statewide significance. \n \nWhere information systems cannot use the above authentication methods, other methods must be used \u2013 all information systems must authenticate securely with encrypted passwords or tokens.  Note that storage or transfer of unencrypted plain text authentication tokens is not acceptable \u2013 all authentication must be encrypted to an acceptable standard.  Please refer to ACSC guidelines such as the Information Security Manual for current government encryption requirements.\n\nOffline Information Assets\nOffline assets\nIt is common to produce one off or regular extracts or subsets of information from existing Wannon Water information assets and share these with stakeholders and consumers.  Such extracts typically take the form of reports or data sets, and can take the form of static electronic or hardcopy artifacts.\n\nSuch \u2018offline\u2019 reports or extracts are still Wannon Water information assets, and as such still require active access management control over their lifetimes.  This includes information extracts that are provided to third parties, although note that this may exclude certain pieces of personally identifying information where there may be transferable ownership rights provided to the recipient, depending upon relevant legislation (i.e. PII rights under the EU General Protection Regulation or other equivalent provisions).\n\nRequesting an extract\nAll extracts of information from an information asset must be approved by the appropriate Authority, typically the information asset steward.\n\nAll requests for extracts (including custom reports) must be submitted to the Information Steward via Wannon Waters\u2019 \u201cRequest for Data\u201d e-form ()\n\nThis e-form will then comprise a record of the request, authorisation and creation of the extract.\nAny request for extraction of information from any other information asset not listed on the e-form must be submitted via email to the Chief Information Officer for approval.\n\nAccess assignment\nAssignment of access rights to an information asset extract is the responsibility of the Information Steward.  The steward is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of their information asset, including any extracts or reports created and / or shared from it.\n\nThe Information Steward is responsible for ensuring appropriate access rights to information asset extracts both initially, as part of the initial creation of the extract or report, and ongoing, for the life of the extract.  In effect, the Information Steward must take all reasonable steps to ensure appropriate access controls are maintained on the information asset extract for the duration of its existence, including those extracts provided to third parties.\n\nThe Information Steward must make all reasonable effort to ensure any third party the information asset extract is provided to has adequate information security controls to protect the information asset extract to the extent Wannon Water requires it protected.\n\nIntellectual property rights\nUnless otherwise stated in any contract, agreement or legislative or regulatory requirement, Wannon Water retains the rights to any intellectual property created in the process of producing or providing any extract, report or statement from a Wannon Water information asset.  Wannon Water may assign the right to access and use that intellectual property to any recipient, but will retain full rights at all times.\n\nWannon Water will follow the guidelines outlined in the Intellectual Property Guidelines for the Victorian Public Sector (2015) and the Whole of Victorian Government Intellectual Property Policy (2012).\n\nExpiry of information asset extract\nTypically any information asset extract will have a fixed life, as they are static, point in time extracts from a dynamic asset.  That being the case, a static extract still has value (for instance in a historic trend model) and should still be access managed.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Information Steward to ensure:\n\nThe end of life date is understood by all consumers of the information asset extract\nAll time expired information asset extracts are removed from general use.  This includes those sent to third parties (this may involve confirmation from the third party that the information asset extract has been destroyed )\nAs time expired information asset extracts typically still have some historic value, they assign appropriate access controls to those extracts.\n\nAccess Monitoring and Reporting\nAccess privileges will be reviewed every six months.  Please refer to the Information System Authorised Access Six Monthly Review procedure for more information.  \n\nIt is the responsibility of individual Information Stewards / Information System Administrators to undertake access reviews, and the accountability of Information Asset / Information Systems owners to ensure such reviews are completed in a timely fashion.  The Information Security Manager has oversight of this review and works with the appropriate Information Stewards / Information System Administrators to ensure its completion.\nDefinitions \n\nGovernance\n\nDocument version history\n\n\n\nAppendix One: Access Request Workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix Two: References\n\nAustralian Cyber Security Centre, Australian Government Information Security Manual, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra ACT, 2018\n\nCommonwealth of Australia, Protective Security Policy Framework: Infosec 9 Access to information, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra ACT, 2019\n\nCommonwealth of Australia, Protective Security Policy Framework: Infosec 10 Safeguarding information from cyber threats, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra ACT, 2019\n\nDepartment of Treasury and Finance, Intellectual Property Guidelines for the Victorian Public Sector, version 1.1, State of Victoria, Melbourne Victoria, 2019\n\nDepartment of Treasury and Finance, Intellectual Property Policy, State of Victoria, Melbourne, 2012\n\nISACA COBIT 5: A Business Framework for the Governance and Management of Enterprise IT, ISACA, Rolling Meadows Illinois, 2012\n\nISACA, The Risk IT Framework, ISACA, Rolling Meadows Illinois, 2009\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST Special Publication 800-53 Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organisations, Revision 4, United States Department of Commerce, Washington DC, 2013\n\nOffice of the Victorian Information Commissioner, Victorian Protective Data Security Framework, State of Victoria, Melbourne Victoria, 2018\n\nRaschke, J. and Walsh, K Sustainable Development for Digital Transformation, Part 1: Applying Environmental Theory to the Digital Ecosystem, ISACA Journal, Volume 5 2019, ISACA, Schaumburg Illinois, 2019\n\nSouffer, K, Pillitteris, V, Lightman, S, Abrams, M, Hahn, A, NIST Special Publication 800-82 Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, Revision 2, United States Department of Commerce, Washington DC, 2015\n\n\n\n", "Access Control Policy.docx"], ["PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this Procedure is to ensure the appropriate use of healthy catering for various in-house/on-site business functions within Wannon Water and that appropriate food choices are made in line with employee health and wellbeing. \nSCOPE\nThe Catering Procedure applies to the entire corporation where food is to be handled and consumed on-site.

The associated document \u201cDigital Change Guideline - SDP Guide\u201d provides detail on how these activities translate into the Wannon Water\u2019s IT Service Management tool - ServiceDesk Plus. \n\nScope\nThis procedure applies to any employee or contractor in Wannon Water who is involved in the change process (including change requests) where the change will be made to a Digital Platform overseen by a Change Authority.  \n\nProcedure Overview\nChange Category\nThe Digital Change Procedures varies according to the Change Category.  \n\n\n\nNote that Business as Usual changes are out of scope for the Digital Change Management Procedure.\n\n\nChange Workflow\nBroadly, changes progress through the following stages:\n\n\n\nProcedure \u2013 Overview\n\n\n\nChange Design\nThis step takes place before the change record is entered into the ITSM tool.  The objective of this step is to translate the need for a change into well designed change records.  Well considered design avoids rework and sets the change(s) up for a smooth approval process, as well as making it more likely that they will be successful.\nThe key aspects of change design are:\nChange category.\nRelated changes.\nChange risk.\nThese are described in more detail in the following sections.\nChange Categorisation\nWhen the need for a change is confirmed, one of the first steps should be to confirm the Change Category, using the definitions described in Section 3.1 Change Category.\nIt is expected that the Change Owner and Change Authority consider the risk and complexity of the individual change to inform the categorisation.\nThe category, combined with change risk, will determine the lead time required for approval of the change, and should be considered when scheduling the change implementation window. \nIn determining the category, the Change Owner and Change Authority should consider the guidance below:  \n\nIf a Change Owner identifies a change which appears to be consistent with one of the pre-approved changes on the agreed list, they should ensure that the change is: \nConsistent with the definition of the pre-approved change category (routine, repeated and low risk).\nConsistent with the definition and intent of the specific pre-approved change.\nIf there is any doubt that it meets these criteria, it should be raised as a normal change.\n\nAn emergency change is a change which is required to prevent or respond to a major incident.  Normal changes where an urgent implementation is desired due to considerations outside this such as staff availability do not meet this definition.  In these cases, the Change Authority and Change Owner should work with the Change Manager to see if the approval process can be expedited.  \n\nRelated Changes \nRelated changes occur when:\nThere is a single change which needs to be applied multiple times across multiple instances.  For example, applying a certificate to multiple apps/servers; migrating sites over to a new telecommunications protocol.\nStaggered rollouts. For example, rollout of an application update to laptops and desktops.  \n\nWhen planning these changes, the Change Owner and the Change Authority should work with the Change Manager to determine whether one or multiple changes should be raised.\n\nWhen determining this, the following should be considered:\nWhether the change risk varies across the different change components.\nWhether the planning varies across the different change components.  \nThe requirement for a meaningful audit trail for anyone who might be scheduling a change or investigating an incident on the same service/infrastructure.  \n\u00a0\nIn making this decision, the Change Owner and Change Manager should consider the guidance below: \nIf the change rollout is staggered as part of good practice to minimise the impact in the very unlikely situation that something goes wrong, it is reasonable to include all the stages in one change record.\nIf the first stage is a pilot, and the learnings will be used to inform future state, then multiple changes are more appropriate to allow for easier changes to schedules or implementation plans. \nA change record which runs over an extended period does not support easy identification of what has changed when.  Unless otherwise agreed with the Change Authority and Change Manager, a change record should not cover a period of more than 5 days. \nIf in doubt, default to more change records rather than less.  This avoids situations where a failure, alteration or rescheduling of just one part of the change requires the whole change to have to be resubmitted and reapproved.  \n\nChange Risk\nThe change risk is determined using Service Criticality and Probability of Failure. These are applied to determine a risk level according to the risk matrix below.  \n\n\nNote that the approval requirement for a normal change varies depending on the risk of the change.\n\nService Criticality\nServices are defined to support the change process, and each has been assigned a criticality which reflects its importance to Wannon Water.  The Change Manager will keep a record of the services and associated criticality, as well as the ITSM service definition including criticality. \n\nCriticality is assessed according to the following definitions: \nHigh \u2013 failure of this service would result in immediate/direct risk to public or employee health or safety or pose a significant environmental impact.\nMedium \u2013 this service is used daily by many employees or is used by a department to deliver a time critical core process or service to stakeholders or customers.\nLow \u2013 not core to day-to-day service delivery and would usually support processes which can be deferred until the system is available or there is a straightforward workaround or manual fallback.\n\n\n\n\nProbability of Failure\n\u201cProbability of Failure\u201d includes a broad range of scenarios, including the change being unable to be implemented, the implementation not going to plan or the change causing incidents or issues after implementation.  \nThis is assessed considering factors such as the number of systems or assets being impacted by the change, the amount of effort to design, build and plan the change, the inherent stability and complexity of the service, the complexity of the implementation, confidence in the rollback procedure and whether a similar change has been successfully completed previously.   \n\nProcedure \u2013 External Change\nAn external change is a change being made to Software as a Service or externally managed infrastructure, where the change is not initiated by Wannon Water, and Wannon Water has no control over the timing or content of the change.\n\nThese changes are recorded centrally for visibility i.e., for consideration in scheduling other changes, incident investigations or responding to queries from end users. \n\n\nProcedure \u2013 Pre-approved Change\nPre-approved changes are routine, repeated, low-risk changes.  \n\nPre-approved Change List\nEach portfolio has an agreed list of pre-approved changes.  This is stored in the ITSM tool; however, the Change Manager will also maintain a separate list to ensure that there is an audit trail of changes to this list. \n\nAdditions and Changes\nThe list of pre-approved changes can be refined or added to as follows: \nDigital Team member identifies a candidate change or a change to an existing pre-approved change.\nChange Owner works with Change Authority to agree or refine a definition which ensures that the scope of the pre-approved change is clear and that higher risk changes cannot be included in error. \nOnce a clear definition is agreed, the Change Authority should provide the details to the Change Manager.\nThe Change Manager should update the ITSM tool, update the pre-approved change audit log and update all impacted change process participants.  \n\nDeletions\nA pre-approved change can be deleted from the list as follows:\nChange Authority provides the details to the Change Manager. \nThe Change Manager should update the ITSM tool, update the pre-approved change audit log and update all impacted change process participants.\n\n\nPre-approved Change Process\nProcedure \u2013 Normal Change\nProcedure \u2013 Emergency Change \n\n\nProcedure \u2013 Rescheduling Changes \nScenario 1: Change is in Planning Stage.\nChange Owner returns the change to submission to update the implementation date.\n\nScenario 2: Change is in Approval or Implementation Stage but has yet reached implementation date. \nChange Owner advises the Change Manager to update and, if necessary, arrange for the change to be re-approved.  \n\nScenario 3: Change implementation date is past.\nChange Owner closes change and records that the change has been cancelled and the reason why.  The procedure to close the change should be consistent with the procedure for the applicable change category.  \n \nProcedure - Post Implementation Review \nThe following changes are in scope for Post Implementation Review (PIR):\nAny change which does not go to plan.\nAny unauthorised change. \nAny medium-risk or high-risk normal change.\nAny emergency change.\n\nThe Change Manager will co-ordinate the completion of the PIR with the Change Owner and Change Authority and any other stakeholders. \n\nThe PIR focusses on learnings to improve change outcomes going forward.  The exact approach and scope of this may vary, but at a minimum will cover:  \nLearnings which could help avoid recurrence of the issue.\nLearnings which could help reduce any adverse impacts if the issue recurs.\nIdentification of actions which were completed which positively impacted the change outcome and should be adopted as common practices or incorporated into procedures.  \n\nIf the change went smoothly or if there are clearly no learnings, the Change Authority can waive the requirement for a PIR.  \n\nRelated Processes\n\nIn the case where the PIR process identifies a reportable event, a recommendation will be included in the PIR for the Change Authority to raise a risk incident.  For definitions of reportable events refer to  .\n\nIndividual feedback relating to performance of change related activities is out of scope for the PIR process. \n\nUnauthorised changes will be reported to the Information Security Manager for evaluation and possible further action under the Cyber Risk and Access Management Frameworks. \n\nReporting\n\nThe Change Manager will report all findings from Post Implementation Reviews to the Change Advisory Board, including where either it has been waived or where recommendations include raising of a risk or cyber incident. \n\nProcedure: Unauthorised Changes\nAn unauthorised change includes\nChanges made to the production environment where no change record was raised.\nChanges made to the production environment where the change did not have the necessary approvals completed before implementation started. \n\nAnyone who identifies an unauthorised change should report it as soon as possible to the relevant Change Authority.\n\nIn the case where a change is completed with no change record being raised, the Change Owner or Change Authority works with the Change Manager to raise a retrospective change to record the details of the change.\n\nThe Change Manager will ensure that unauthorised changes:\nAre reported to the Change Advisory Board.\nHave a Post Implementation Review completed in line with the procedure documented in Section 3.10. \n\nRoles and responsibilities\n\n\nDefinitions \nGovernance\n\n\n\nDocument version history\n\n", "Digital Change Procedure.docx"], ["Purpose\nThis procedure aims to guide people in how to manage controlled documentation.

Please call the IT Team for further Instructions\nSpam\nSpam is defined as \u201cjunk email\u201d.  It is unsolicited, and is usually attempting to sell goods or services.  \n\nThe email filtering software scans all incoming emails for key words and phrases which may identify email as spam.  The software prevents the email from being delivered to the employ.\n\nThe filtering software should capture most spam, however there will still be some that are missed and which will appear in employee\u2019s mailboxes.  Should you receive spam, Employees should click the link at the bottom of the email that states \n\u201cClick  to report this email as spam.\u201d\n .  Clicking this link will configure the filtering software to block similar messages in the future.  Do not reply to the email, do not purchase anything via a SPAM email, do not use your email address to register for information (e.g. newsletters).\n\nChain letters\nThe purpose of chain letters is to cause disruption to the network, or the workplace generally, by enticing the recipient to forward a message to multiple recipients.  \n\nIf you are concerned about the content of an email, then you should NOT forward it to any employees, Please Call the IT Team for further Instructions\nJoke e-mails\nJoke emails have the potential to disrupt the network and affect productivity.  Employees should request that such emails be diverted to private email addresses.  The IT team reserves the right to blacklist serial senders of joke emails.\n\nHoaxes (Phishing)\nPhishing is a way of fraudulently acquiring sensitive information, such as credit card or bank account information by misleading recipients with official-looking messages.\n\nPhishing e-mails can appear to come from legitimate institutions such as your bank, credit card company, etc, but they usually come from a criminal trying to steal information. \n\nPhishing can be avoided by following these guidelines:\n\nNever send sensitive account information in an e-mail message.\nNever go to a sensitive site through an e-mail link; always type the site name directly into your browser (such as www.commbank.com.au).\nNever give any password out to anyone.\nIf your bank requires verification, do it over the phone or in person.\nVerify any person who contacts you unsolicited, claiming to be customer support.\n\nIf you are concerned about the content of an email, then you should contact the IT team for further Instructions \n\n\n\n\nAttachments\nLarge attachments\n\nAny attachment that is greater than two (2) Megabytes in size is classified as \u201clarge\u201d.\n\nSuch attachments should not be forwarded to distribution lists Alternative access methods should be arranged for these files.

Its reasonable use for personal purposes is acceptable.  This use should not affect employee productivity, disrupt the network, or the administration of the network.\n\nAs mentioned, all e-mails are subject to filtering.  If an email is not business-related, and has been quarantined, then the employee can request its release from the IT team.\n\nEmail must not be used for personal advantage, e.g. for the advertising of goods.\n\nPersonal use is not to extend beyond the directives and policies associated with work use, as outlined in this document.\n\nWhen sending a personal e-mail, employees must be mindful that the e-mail address and signature both identify them as employees of Wannon Water.  This can result in personal opinions being misconstrued as statements being made on behalf of Wannon Water.  To avoid this situation, personal use must avoid making any comment related to the organisation and/or its activities.\n\n\nPersonal email accounts\nThe use of personal e-mail accounts (e.g. Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail) for business correspondence is not permitted.\n\n\nMonitoring Email Usage\nIt is reasonable to expect that email will only be accessed by those to whom the email is addressed.\n\nNo employee\u2019s email will be monitored unless a complaint has arisen or there is reasonable suspicion that something is amiss.  In this case, the Managing Director, the relevant General Manager or Branch Manager  must grant approval before monitoring can take place.\n\nCircumstances, resulting in the access of an individual\u2019s emails, could include the following:\nprotecting the system security (e.g. tracking viruses)\ninvestigating indications of breach of procedure\naccessing business data in the event of an employee\u2019s absence\nthe circulation of inappropriate emails \n\nNote that the IT team is responsible for reviewing the email quarantine area and forwarding legitimate mail to staff.\n\nFor further details with regards to the monitoring of e-mail, see the document titled  Procedure for Accessing Commvault Email Journal.\n\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\n\n\nProcedure breaches will be subject to Wannon Water's Consequences of Employee Misconduct procedure.\n\nThe use of Wannon Water systems for accessing, generating, transmitting, recording, downloading or storing offensive material as defined, is considered as serious misconduct. \n\n\n\nGeneral Guidelines\n\nGeneral security practices\n\nIf you think something seems wrong with an e-mail, delete it immediately.\nIf you get a message asking you to install something when you open e-mail, click \"No\" or simply exit, and then delete the e-mail.\nIf an e-mail direct you to a web site that ask you to install something, click \"No\" or simply exit, and then delete the e-mail.\nNever open e-mail attachments from someone you do not know.  If you think the attachment may be legitimate, send an e-mail to the person who sent it, and confirm that they indeed did send it.\n\nMisinterpretation of Email\n\nMissing body language and tone can cause what was meant as a humorous message to be taken other than intended.  Thus, great care should be taken in crafting the \u201ctone\u201d of an email message, and in providing the recipient with the information needed to appropriately interpret the emotional nature of the contents.\n\nThe difficulty with communicating subtlety and the room for misinterpretation of emails suggests that email is more effective as a factual tool, and users should consider other forms of communication to ensure they are properly understood.\n\nAn example where misinterpretation could occur is the interpretation of the use of capital letters.  Some people may see this as an aggressive tone.\n\nLack of Control\n\nRemember that while you may think that sending a joke to a friend is fine, once you click on the \u201cSEND\u201d button, you have no control over where that email may subsequently end up; and your name will remain as the originator for all to see.\n\n\nConfidentiality \u2013 email threads\n\nEmails will often comprise a \u201cthread\u201d of an ongoing conversation, made up of many different emails, which are attached to the bottom of the one sent to you.  Before forwarding this email, ensure that you have checked the content of all attached emails, to ensure that confidentiality is not breached.\n\n\nThink of others\n\nRemember that what may not be offensive to you could be regarded as offensive to the recipient.\n\nAnnoying Material\n\nIf you receive emails that are annoying in their content, are not relevant and/or their frequency is causing productivity problems, then take action.  Contact the originator and ask to be removed from the distribution list.\n\nTimeliness\n\nRemember that just becse an email is sent instantly to someone\u2019s account, this does not mean that it is instantly read.  Remember also your message is only one part of the recipient\u2019s workload, and not necessarily their highest priority.\n\nIf the matter is of an urgent nature (e.g.. a reply is needed within 1-2 days), consider a phone call or direct conversation to highlight the importance of the reply.\n\nMail box management\n\nA limit is imposed on the size of mail boxes.  This is to conserve disk space and to encourage staff to frequently audit their email, and delete those that are not important.  All business correspondence should be registered in Trim, then deleted from the mailbox.  \n\n\nBlank subject lines\n\nEmails should always be given a meaningful subject.  This is useful for identification, filing and retrieval of emails.  A blank subject line is also an indication  that an email contains spam or a virus.  As such, these emails are quarantined by the filtering software.\n\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\nThe Branch Manager Knowledge and Technology is responsible for maintaining this document and making managers aware of any changes to it.\n\nAll managers are responsible for making their staff aware of any changes to this document.\n\nAnyone with access to the Wannon Water computer network is responsible for abiding by this document.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\nElectronic Messaging\nFor the purposes of this procedure \u2018Electronic Messaging\u2019 is defined as the creation and transmission of communication messages using email (Microsoft Outlook).  Messages may be transmitted either internally to Wannon Water employees, or to external parties. \n\nOffensive material\n\nOffensive material could be defined as, but is not restricted to, any of the following:\nof a sexual or pornographic nature, or \nviolent, or\nany material that can be construed to be harassment or disparagement of others\u2019 beliefs, their sex, race sexual orientation, age, national origin, or religious or political beliefs.\n\nEmployees are to exercise caution and good judgement if there is a reasonable expectation that the material may be considered offensive by others.\n\nCyber bullying\n - An independent community advisory body established by the Australian government (http://www.netalert.gov.au/advice/risks/cyberbullying/What_is_cyber_bullying.html) defines cyber bullying as:\n\n\"Bullying that is carried out through an internet service, such as email, chat room, discussion group or instant messaging.

Employees approached by a fellow staff member raising issues of family and domestic violence should as much as possible refer their colleague to this procedure.\n\n\n      Types of support available to employees experiencing family violence\nWannon Water offers a variety of support avenues for employees experiencing family and domestic violence, including:\n\n     Safety Planning\nWannon Water understands that there may be occasions where an employee is at risk of family violence in the workplace. In such circumstances, Wannon Water is committed to working with the employee to implement a workplace safety plan to improve the safety of the employee and their colleagues.\n\nPeople and Wellbeing can offer guidance in safety planning, which may include putting in place temporary or permanent precautionary measures to ensure the safety and wellbeing of staff and students experiencing domestic and family violence.\n\nA safety plan is to be developed in consultation with the employee and their line manager. A Family and Domestic Leave Safety Plan template is available on SoControl.  A copy of the completed Safety Plan is to be provided to Manager People and Wellbeing or Executive People and Resilience to be confidentially recorded. \n\nThe plan should reflect the specific needs of the employee and take into account the nature of their role and the workplace environment. Precautionary measures that may be included safety plan may but are not limited to:\nManaging telephone, email or mail harassment.\nChanging the employee\u2019s contact details and/or removing them from public directories/information.\nSecurity arrangements are in place (e.g  restricted area and escorting entry to and exit from the building, i.e., to car park or public transport.\nAccess to cab vouchers, alternative transport arrangements or emergency phones \nTemporary or permanent relocation of the employee to a more secure work area, and/or support in working remotely conditions.\nSetting up procedures for alerting security and/or the police (if appropriate).\nAction to be taken if the employee does not arrive at work.\nAny other reasonable measures determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn developing a safety plan, the following should be considered: \nThe plan must have the employee\u2019s agreement and consent.\nIt should be reviewed with the employee on a regular basis.\nThe employee\u2019s emergency contact details must be kept up to date.\nAll reasonable attempts should be made to ensure employees maintain their normal working hours and working conditions to minimise the impact on the individual and their team.\nCo-operation with legal orders (e.g. Apprehended Violence Orders) may be required.\nThe employee may need us to provide supporting evidence and documentation for legal or other purposes.\nFlexible working arrangements and leave arrangements. \n\nA decision to implement any precautionary measures should be made in consultation with Manager People and Wellbeing or Executive People and Resilience. \n\n     Leave\nAn employee, including casuals, experiencing family and domestic violence has access to 20 days per anniversary year of paid special leave for medical appointments, legal proceedings and other activities related to family violence. \n\nThis leave resets on the employee\u2019s work anniversary and does not accumulate from year to year. If an employee has exhausted all 20 days of family and domestic leave, consideration will be given to providing additional leave. \n\nFamily and domestic violence leave is in addition to existing leave entitlements and may be taken as consecutive or single days or as a fraction of a day.  Whilst prior approval is not required, employees accessing family and domestic leave should notify their line manager or People and Wellbeing as soon as practicably possible. \n\nPeople & Wellbeing are to be notified of the leave as soon as practical.

Note:\nThis section does not apply to tables, \nlists and charts in documents such as \nfinancial reports where numerals can \nbe used\nWannon Water   |   Our Voice Guide   |   Jan 2023   |   PAGE 15\nGetting the basics right -  \nApostrophes\nContractions \nContractions are used when two words are \ncombined to sound more casual or informal. \nThe apostrophe is always placed where the \nletter/s have been removed. \nSome common examples are:\n\u2022 couldn't - could not\n\u2022 doesn't - does not\n\u2022 don't - do not\n\u2022 he'll - he will\n\u2022 I'd - I would \n\u2022 I'll - I will\n\u2022 I'm - I am\n\u2022 isn't - is not\n\u2022 it's - it is OR it has\n\u2022 she'd - she would\n\u2022 we're  - we are\n\u2022 who's - who is\n\u2022 you'll - you will\n\u2022 you're  - you are.Possession\nPossessive apostrophes show that a thing (a \nnoun) belongs or is related to someone or \nsomething else. \nSingular nouns and names\nWhen the noun is singular, add an \napostrophe plus 's' e.g:  Wannon Water's \npipeline, one week's notice.\nWhen a singular noun already ends in 's', add \nan apostrophe plus another 's' (the general \nrule is you should write it as you say it) e.g: \nJames's pen.\nPlural nouns\nFor plural nouns that end with an 's', add \nan apostrophe AFTER the 's'. For example if \nthere is more than one water authority or \nweek e.g:  The water authorities' pipelines, \ntwo weeks' notice.\nFor plural nouns that don't end with an \n's' (e.g. children, men and women), add \nan apostrophe BEFORE the 's' e.g: The \nchildren's poster competition, International \nWomen's Day.It\u2019s vs its\nOne of the most common apostrophe \nmistakes is placing an apostrophe in the \nword ITS to show something belongs to IT. \nBut this rule doesn\u2019t apply to pronouns \u2013 its, \nyours, his, hers, ours, theirs. As outlined, it\u2019s \nis always a contraction of 'it is' or 'it has'.\nIts describes something that belongs to it \ne.g: The committee elected its president, the \nvehicle had its service. \nThe easiest way to remember this rule is \nto read it back to yourself. The committee \nelected it's president effectively reads the \ncommittee elected it is president, which \ndoesn't make sense.\nWhen NOT to use an apostrophe\nDon't use an apostrophe just because a \nword is plural e.g. reports (not report's), \nUSBs  (not USB's), 1990s  (not 1990's).\nHowever, if you are referring to something \nthat belongs to a decade, add an apostrophe  \ne.g. the 1990s' pipeline . \nWannon Water   |   Our Voice Guide   |   Jan 2023   |   PAGE 16\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples ,\nUse culturally appropriate and respectful \nlanguage when writing with, for, or about \nFirst Nations Australians. \u2018Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 is most often \nconsidered best practice. Using 'First Peoples' \nand \u2018First Nations\u2019 is also generally acceptable. \nAge diversity\nAvoid referring to a person\u2019s age or an age \ngroup if it\u2019s not relevant. Standalone words in \neveryday use, like \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018young\u2019, can carry \nbias or unintended subtext. Words that carry \nstereotypes, for example \u2018elderly\u2019, are not \nacceptable.\nWhen an age or age range is relevant to \na fact, you can use the term \u2018people\u2019 with \nthe age reference e.g.  Survey data showed \npeople aged 15 to 17 years were the highest \nproportion of internet users.Gender and sexual diversity\nInclusive language conveys gender equality \nand is gender neutral. Respect peoples\u2019 \npreferences around gender and sexual \nidentity with pronoun choice, job titles and \npersonal titles.\nDo not default to a generic gendered \npronoun like 'he' or 'she' to talk about a \ngeneric person. Instead, use 'they', 'their' and \n'them' to refer to singular subjects as this \nallows you to speak to a broader audience of \nmen, women, and other identifying genders.\nUnless gender is relevant, always use gender-\nneutral words rather than gender-specific \nones. For example, use 'workforce' instead of \n'manpower', 'artificial' instead of 'man made', \nand 'access point' rather than 'manhole'.\nDon\u2019t ask for a preferred title (e.g. Mr, Mrs, \nMs) or gender identity in a form or survey \nunless you specifically need to collect this \ninformation. \nOn a side note, when giving addressing a \ngroup, avoid the term \"ladies and gentlemen\". \nInstead, simply use 'good morning', 'good \nafternoon' or 'welcome everyone' which are \nall inclusive.People with a disability\nDisability does not define people. Use \ninclusive language that respects diversity e.g: \nperson with disability  (NOT disabled person), \nperson who is deaf or hard of hearing  (NOT \ndeaf person), person who is blind or has low \nvision  (NOT blind person).\nCultural and linguistic diversity\nAustralians have different cultural \nbackgrounds and speak many languages. Use \ninclusive language that respects this diversity. \nYou can use the general term \u2018multicultural \ncommunities\u2019 to write about people from \ndifferent cultural backgrounds.\nWhen you ask people their name, don\u2019t ask \nfor \u2018Christian name\u2019, \u2018first name\u2019, \u2018forename\u2019 \nor \u2018surname\u2019. These terms all take for granted \nthe European conventions and order of \nnames. Instead, ask for their given name and \nfamily name.\nFurther help  \n\u2022 Australian Government Style Manual \nstylemanual.gov.au\n\u2022 Diversity Council of Australia  \ndca.org.au/inclusive-languageInclusive language\nAt Wannon Water, we use inclusive language because it's effective language  \n\u2013 it is respectful, accurate and relevant to all. \nWannon Water   |   Our Voice Guide   |   Jan 2023   |   PAGE 17\nGlossary\nThe glossary on the following pages serves as a resource for employees and \naims to ensure our communications are clear, simple and consistent.\nIf you need help or would like clarification about the use of other words, \nplease contact the Communications Team.\nWannon Water   |   Our Voice Guide   |   Jan 2023   |   PAGE 18\nGlossary\nA\nabout  Preferred over the word \napproximately.\nActs of Parliament  Capitalise and italics \ne.g. Water Act 1989 . \naddress  As in addressing an issue or \nproblem.

These outcomes assist our organisation to achieve our strategic direction.\n\nBeyond water for strong communities.\n\nA systematic approach to risk management is critical in the delivery of our services. \n\nWannon Water must manage risk in line with our regulatory obligations, in particular section 5-1 in our Statement of Obligations 2015:\n\n\u201cThe Corporation must develop and implement plans, systems and processes, having regard to the ISO 31000 Risk Management (or as amended) to ensure that risks associated with functions performed and services provided by the Corporation are identified, assessed, prioritised and managed.\u201d\n\nUnder the Standing Direction(s) of the Minister for Finance (3.7.1) we are obligated to apply the Victorian Government Risk Management Framework (VGRMF).\n\nTo maintain certification of our Zero Harm management system (to ISO 14001-Environment) and ISO 45001-OHS) we must ensure processes are in place to manage risks and opportunities associated with our activities and compliance obligations. \n\nThis framework is applicable to all employees within Wannon Water and all risk types defined within this plan.\n\nRisk Management Framework\nOur risk management framework is based on the principles in ISO 31000:2018.\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Principles (ISO 31000:2018)\n\n\nThe framework consists of the following elements: \n\nRisk Policy Statement (within the Board Policy Framework. Includes risk appetite)\nHazard and Risk Management Standard \nRisk Management Plan (this document)\nRisk Management Procedure1 (and referenced supporting/guidance documents) \nStrategic and operational risk consequence categories (describe the criteria for assessment of risks)\nStrategic and operational risk registers and assessments (as described within the Risk Management Procedure)  \n\nThe framework is supported by the following systems or processes:\nStrategic and Project Investment Planning processes (incorporate consideration of strategic and operational risk) \nHazard and Incident registers (within RiskWare)\nWannon Water Audit Program (provides assurance that risk controls are effective)\nWannon Water Emergency Management Framework (provides guidance on activities to mitigate, respond to and recover from emergency risks)\nZero Harm Management System standards and supporting documents (provide further guidance on requirements to manage risk and meet applicable obligations)\nRisk Appetite and Permission Statements  \nWe need to take risks to fulfil our strategic intent and we\u2019re careful about when we choose to do this. The Risk Policy Statement which forms part of the Board Policy Framework details the principles, guidance and expectations in how the organisation operates.\n\nThe overarching principle is that we will operate within our risk appetite statement:\n\nWannon Water will accept and manage risks in pursuit of our purpose and strategic direction.\n\nWannon Water will:\nBe risk averse in relation to physical safety and mental wellbeing of people, drinking water safety and harm to the environment, consistent with our Zero Harm aspiration\nHave a low-risk approach for our customer commitments, reliable water and sewerage services, cyber security and governance systems\nHave a medium risk approach to opportunities to strengthen our region\nBe open to opportunities that have significant potential for increased organisational performance.\n\n\n\nRisk Management Goals and Objectives \nFor the risk management framework to be effective the following goals and objectives have been identified and can be updated and refined as needed:\n\nGoal: To ensure that risks facing our organisation are appropriately managed to support the delivery of our strategic direction and assist decision-making processes.\n\nObjectives: The following are the objectives of the risk management framework;\n\nRisk management is incorporated into all planning activities\nAll employees receive applicable risk management training to improve and maintain their risk management skills\nRisk information is maintained in accordance with specified requirements\nReports provide information necessary to make risk informed decisions\n\nDefinition of Risk \nWannon Water has adopted the following definition of risk.\n\nAn event that could/will occur that will impact on organisation objectives. It is measured in terms of likelihood and consequence.\n\nRisk Governance \nForums and mechanisms have been established for the board to oversee the risk management practices across the business (See figure 2), including the implementation of a sound Risk Management Framework.\n\nRisk governance is well established at both board level and within the organisation. Members with adequate skill sets and competencies to provide an appropriate level of oversight from a risk management perspective compose the Board and Committees, including obtaining assurance over the operation of approved risk management procedures.\n\nRisk is a recurring agenda item at Board and Executive Management level. \n\n\nFigure 2 - Board Oversight\nRoles, Responsibilities & Resources\nWannon Water will ensure it is accountable, and has the authority and competence for managing risk by:\n\n\nWannon Water has allocated the following resources for risk management:\nAudit and Risk Management Committee of Board\nIndependent Internal Auditor\nIMS Management Review Committee\nBusiness Resilience Committee\nRisk Management resource\nRisk management software\nBudgets to facilitate risk assessment and management processes\nRisk management training\nCorporate membership of the Risk Management Institute of Australasia (RMIA)\n\nRisk Management Process\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Process (ISO 31000:2018)\n\nThe risk assessment and measurement processes allow Wannon Water to consider the extent to which potential events may have an impact on the achievement of its objectives. It encompasses qualitative and quantitative approaches, processes, tools and systems developed and implemented to identify, assess, and measure risks.\n\n\nThis section provides overview of the key steps in the Risk Management process. For further guidance please refer to specific Risk Management procedures available on WaterShed or the Risk and Resilience team.\nCommunication and Consultation\nCommunication and consultation should take place during all steps of the Risk Management process with both internal and external stakeholders.\n\nAll stakeholders should understand the reasons why decisions are made and why particular actions are required.\nWithin Wannon Water this could be achieved through:\nAudit and Risk Management Committee\nExecutive Committee\nTeam meetings\nRisk workshops\nTraining in the application of the risk management framework\nHazard Assessment and Incident Investigation\nEngagement with regulators, government and the water sector\n\nScope, Context and Criteria \n10.2.1 Defining the Scope \nRisk Management needs to be a core part of effective business planning and management. A rigorous approach is driven by Senior Management and integrated within all business activities. It should provide a check that we are working to the correct objectives, improve strategic planning and facilitate the design of a control structure.\n\nRisk Management should also be a dynamic process which informs strategic and individual funding decisions. Business planning and risk assessments should be seen as complementary functions. It is vital to assess the events that may affect the organisations ability to meet its key objectives.\n\nThe proactive and systematic approach to the identification, analysis and management of risk will have a significant impact on not only the achievement of our objectives but will also provide the opportunity for the organisation to seek out and effectively exploit opportunities that will further enhance the services we provide to our customers.\n\nThe risk management process is applied to different levels within Wannon Water.\n10.2.2 Risk Types\nStrategic Risk: Strategic Risks are events that if occurred would materially affect the achievement of our purpose and strategic intent. They are identified by the Board and Executive and owned by the Executive. The Board via the Audit and Risk Management Committee monitor the risk profile and the status of controls and where necessary risk treatment plans.\n\nThe review of Strategic Risks is an integral part of the strategic planning process and informs strategic planning and decision making. \n\nOperational Risk: Operational risks are events that if occurred would affect the achievement of our business as usual. As such these are the risk of loss resulting from the lack of, inadequate or failed internal processes, people and/or systems, or from external events. Operational risk captures risks requiring business continuity plans, environmental risk, crisis management, fraud risks, process systems and operations risk, people related risks and health and safety, and information technology. The risks can be owned by anyone where they have sufficient delegated authority to be able to resource the treatment of the risk.\n\nProject Risk: Project risks impact on the achievement of individual projects, change to processes or programs of work.\n\nThey can be identified throughout the stages of the project. Project Managers are expected to implement risk management processes to ensure effective and efficient delivery of projects.\n\nShared Risk & State Significant Risks: Shared risks (previously known as inter-agency risks) are identified and managed through communication, collaboration and when in our span of control coordinated with impacted agencies. \n\nIn addition to the strategic, operational and project level risks, we are required to identify risks that we have identified could contribute to a state significant risk.\nIf a shared risk or state significant risk is brought to our attention from another agency, Wannon Water will work collaboratively with the identifying agency in analysing and evaluating the risk collaboratively. \n\nIn annual reporting to DEECA any reportable risk (Strategic Risks) that could be considered to be contributing to a shared risk, emergency or state significant risk are highlighted.\n10.2.3 External and Internal Context \nUnderstanding the context is an important step in the Risk management process. \nThe external context is the operating environment in which the organisation seeks to achieve its objectives. The external context can include, but is not limited to:\n\nThe social and cultural, political, legal, regulatory, financial, technological, economic, natural and competitive environment\nKey drivers and trends having impact on the objectives of the organisation; and\nRelationships with perceptions and values of external stakeholders\n\nTo assist with defining the external context and considering emerging trends and threats we:\n\nEngage with the water sector and government at a state and national level \nEngage with our regulators\nEngage with customers and the community within our service region\nUtilise the World Economic Forum Annual Global Risk report and access other documents such as the Gartner Quarterly emerging risk report and Melbourne Waters Environmental scan as part of the Strategic planning process\n\nOur context internally is set by our Strategic Direction (Corporate Plan) and our strategies and management plans.  The internal context is the business environment in which the organisation seeks to achieve its objectives. This can include, but is not limited to:\n\nGovernance, organisational structure, roles and accountabilities\nPolicies, objectives, and the strategies that are in place to achieve them\nCapabilities, understood in terms of resources and knowledge (e.g., capital, time, people, processes, systems and technologies)\nThe relationships with and perceptions and values of internal stakeholders\nThe organisation's culture\nThe organisation\u2019s risk appetite\nInformation systems, information flows and decision-making processes (both formal and informal)\nStandards, guidelines and models adopted by the organisation; and,\nForm and the extent of contractual relationships\n\nA Zero Harm approach is an important element of Wannon Water\u2019s risk management philosophy. The Zero Harm approach is an aspiration rather than a defined target. It is a collective mindset and goes beyond the physical safety of people to include mental health and wellbeing and the environments we work in.\n\nIt\u2019s Zero harm to people and Zero Harm to our environment. \n\nIt sees us empowering our people to:\nPromote safe behaviours in the workplace\nIntervene where necessary to support zero harm outcomes\nConsider environmental impacts\nBe their authentic self in a safe, inclusive workplace\n\n10.2.4 Criteria \nImpact Categories \nEvaluating the impacts that would be created if a risk became reality is important, as it helps determine if the risk requires treatment and to support decisions.\n\nThe consequence categories we utilise to assess risks are:\n\nSafety\nService availability\nEnvironmental\nWater quality\nReputation\nFinancial\nLegal\nIT\n\nFurther details on the criteria for the amount of risk we are willing to accept and against which we analyse and evaluate our risks are contained within:\nRisk Policy Statement (and Risk Appetite)\nRisk Permission Statements\nStrategic and Operational Risk Consequence Categories\nRiskWare Risk Assessment module business rules\nOther technical criteria defined within the Risk Management Procedure (e.g., ANCOLD Dam Safety Guidelines)\nRisk Identification\nRisk identification is a process used to formally identify and record risks that may help or prevent the achievement of objectives. In order to effectively identify risks, it is critical to establish the context and boundaries in which risks will be identified.\n \nA risk exists when a source has the potential to have a negative or positive impact. Risk identification is done at various levels, both within and outside Wannon Water. When identifying risk, consideration should be given to determining:\nTangible and intangible sources of risk \nCauses and events\nThreats and opportunities \nWho/what specifically is involved in that source (e.g., contractors)\nWhat consequences would arise from that source (e.g., influence water quality, not deliver on time)\nTo what level this would negatively or positively affect each of the impact areas\nSources of Risk \nA source of risk is where the risk is originating.  Clearly identifying sources of risk is important, as the first approach to treating risk is often to influence the source of risk before it becomes an issue. Using a standard list of sources of risk during identification reduces the likelihood that risks will be missed.\n\nThe standard sources of risk used in risk management for Wannon Water are:\n\nEmployees\nCustomers and other Stakeholders (Non-Government)\nSuppliers and Contractors\nRegulators\nGovernment Stakeholders \u2013 Federal, State, Local\nInformation Technology\nAssets\nMaterials\nProcesses \nGlobal Events and Trends\nNatural Events / Climate Change / Extreme / Emergency Events\nRisk Evaluation\nRisk is analysed by determining consequences or benefits and their likelihood, and other attributes of the risk. An event can have multiple consequences and can affect multiple objectives. All risks (threats) should be assessed across all consequence categories and the most likely outcome (not the worst possible outcome) should be selected.\n\nWe will record all measures of consequence and will report on the highest rated consequence.\n\nAll risks should be assessed prior to any controls (processes, procedures contingency plans). This is the inherent risk.\n \nExisting controls or future actions and their effectiveness are taken into account when determining the residual risk.\n\nThe confidence in the level of risk and its sensitivity to preconditions and assumptions should be considered in the analysis and communicated to appropriate audiences.\n\nOpportunities that are identified should be assessed through the development of a business case.\n\nThe purpose of risk evaluation is to help make decisions (based on the outcomes of risk analysis) about which risks need further treatment and their priority.\n\nRisk evaluation involves comparing the level of risk with the risk criteria established when the context was considered.\n\nThis can lead to:\n\nDo nothing further \u2013 accept the risk\nConsider risk treatment options\nUndertake further analysis to better understand the risk\nMaintain existing controls\nReconsider objectives\n\nThe outcome of the risk evaluation should be recorded, communicated and validated.\n\nThis could be achieved by logging in the Risk register or by way of report to the Executive or Board.\n\nRisk Treatment \nRisks are assessed using the relevant risk criteria, appetite and ranked in an order of priority to indicate which risks are within tolerance or otherwise. Risks that fall outside of tolerance may need treatment.\n\nRisk treatment is a risk modification process. It involves selecting and implementing one or more treatment options. Once the risk treatment has been implemented, it becomes a control, or it modifies existing control(s). Risk treatment involves selecting appropriate options for modifying risks, then implementing those options.\n\nRisk treatment options are not necessarily mutually exclusive or appropriate in all circumstances. The options can include:\n\nAvoid \u2013 seeking to eliminate uncertainty by deciding not to start or continue with the activity that gives rise to the threat, or by removing the source of risk.\nTransfer/Share \u2013 passing ownership and/or liability to a third party (note this only removes a certain amount of risk, reputational risk normally remains). \nMitigate \u2013 decreasing the likelihood and/or consequence of the threat. \nAccept \u2013 recognising residual risk and devising responses to control and monitor them\n\n10.6.1 Selecting risk treatment options \nSelecting the most appropriate risk treatment option involves balancing the costs and efforts against the benefits to be gained, with regard to legal, regulatory and other requirements such as social responsibility and protecting the natural environment. Decisions should also take into account those risks that warrant treatment that is not justifiable on economic grounds, e.g. severe (high negative or positive consequences) but rare (low likelihood) risks.\n\nThe treatment plan should clearly identify the priority order for individual risk treatments.\n\nRisk treatment can also introduce secondary risks. A secondary risk can be either a new threat or a new opportunity. A significant secondary threat can be the failure or ineffectiveness of the risk treatment.\n\n\nIt is good practice to record a secondary risk as a new risk, and to identify a link within the risk treatment plan that generated it.\n\nWhen considering existing and future risk treatments, risk assessors should use the Hierarchy of Controls for threats:\n\nElimination of the task or item being used\tMost Effective Option\nSubstitution to a less hazardous risk\nEngineering out the risk\nAdministratively organising the task or item to diminish the risk\nInsurance\t\t\t\t\tLeast Effective Option\n\nSafety related (including Drinking water quality) and Environmental operational risks will be managed to reduce the risk \u201cSo Far As is Reasonably Practicable. (SFARP) This is in line with our risk appetite statement \n\nControls should be implemented to reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring and to prevent harm to people, property and/or asset damage and potential liability claims made against Wannon Water.\n\n 10.6.2 Risk Treatment Plans \nA risk treatment plan documents how the chosen treatment options will be implemented. The information provided in treatment plans should include:\n\nThe reasons for selection of treatment options, including expected benefits to be gained\nThose who are accountable for approving the plan and those responsible for implementing the plan\nProposed actions\nResource requirements including contingencies\nPerformance measures and constraints\nReporting and monitoring requirements; and,\nTiming and schedule\n\nThe majority of Risk treatment plans will be captured in our risk management software tool and actions should be discussed with appropriate stakeholders. In the rare event that a more formal documented risk management plan is required then this can be prepared in conjunction with the Risk Owner. This will mainly be for larger type projects which involve contractors.\n\nDecision makers and other stakeholders should be aware of the nature and extent of the residual risk after risk treatment. The residual risk should be documented and subjected to monitoring, review and, where appropriate, further treatment.\n\n Risk Response \nRisk response can be assessed against the following criteria:\nAppropriate \u2013 the correct level of response must be determined, based on the \u201csize\u201d of the risk\nAffordable \u2013 the cost effectiveness of responses must be determined to ensure that the amount of effort spent mitigating the threat or enhancing the opportunity does not exceed the \u201creward\u201d\nActionable \u2013 an action window should be determined within which responses need to be completed\nAchievable \u2013 responses must be realistically achievable or feasible\nAssessed \u2013 a post-response risk assessment should be carried out to ensure that responses have actually worked\nAgreed \u2013 the consensus and commitment of stakeholders should be obtained before agreeing to responses\nAllocated and accepted \u2013 each response should be owned and accepted to ensure a single point of responsibility and accountability for implementing the response\n\n Monitoring and Review \n10.8.1 Strategic Risks \nStrategic Risks are owned and managed by specified General Managers. The health of a strategic risk is monitored through agreed Key Risk Indicators and thresholds.\n\nStrategic Risks are reviewed by the relevant General Manager dependent on the level of residual risk.\n\n\nThis review is undertaken by the Risk Owner in our Risk management software with updates provided to the Audit and Risk Management Committee in the 6 monthly update (see Recording and Reporting section).\n\nAdditional oversight and monitoring are undertaken by completion of a \u201cDeep dive\u201d review on a specific Strategic Risk. This is managed and facilitated by the relevant General Manager and involves the Board. Following the Board Deep Dive, items which the Board deem to require further clarification or work are delegated to the Audit and Risk Management Committee for further action and/or review.\n\nThe output from these risk and Deep Dive reviews assist with Strategic planning and decision making. \n\nThese reviews also inform if any amendments to the risk level or further treatments are required.\n\n10.8.1 Operational & Project Risks \nMonitoring and review takes place during all stages of the process. \nThe monitoring and review methodology is embedded in the relevant Risk Management processes and procedures. \n\nAll risks will be monitored. The level of the review will be dependent on the level of the residual risk.\nAdditionally Risk owners and control owners will be requested to review the risks/ controls whenever there is a trigger (i.e. an incident or audit finding related to either a risk event or a control.)\n\n Recording and Reporting \n10.9.1 Strategic Risks \nAll strategic risks are recorded in the Wannon Water Risk Register.\n\nKey Risk Indicators are developed and continually refined for each of the strategic risks. Management gather and record information pertaining to each Key Risk Indicator for monitoring purposes.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the relevant General Manager to ensure that the Board is informed if any of the information recorded triggers an indicator red threshold. The Board report should detail the reason for the indicator being triggered and include actions as to how this is going to be managed or how the risk is going to be treated to reduce either the likelihood or consequence.\n\nSix monthly (May and November) strategic risk trend reporting is provided to the Audit and Risk Management Committee.\n\n10.9.2 Operational Risks \nRisk trend data and an assessment of key operational risks will be provided to the Executive Committee on a quarterly basis. This reporting will commence when operational risk workshops commence.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Management Committee will be provided with trend data and an overview of key operational risks annually. It is envisaged that this will take place each February.\n\n\n\n Key Risk Management Activities \n\n\n\n References \nISO 31000 Risk Management Guidelines\nDepartment of Treasury and Finance Standing Directions of the Minister for Finance 2018 (revised December 2019) (under the Financial Management Act 1994)\nMinisterial Standing Direction 3.7.1 \u2013 Risk management framework and processes\nMinisterial Standing Direction 3 Governance\nSection 41 (2) Water Industry Act 1994 Statement of Obligations (2015)\nPart 5 \u2013 Risk Management\nDepartment of Treasury and Finance (July 2018) Victorian Government Risk Management Framework \u2013 August 2020\nISO 14001 (Environment) and ISO 45001 (OHS) \u2013 6.1 Actions to address risks and opportunities\n\t", "Risk Management Plan.DOCX"], ["Purpose\nThis procedure specifies Wannon Water\u2019s commitment to providing a smoke free workplace.

Our origins can be traced back to the 1860s and 1870s when the need for a reliable domestic water supply system became evident in the towns of Hamilton and Warrnambool, primarily to prevent disease and support development.\nWater storages and pipe networks were constructed \nand extended across the region and water was sourced from a wide range of sources \u2013 from protected forested catchments, agricultural land and plantation forests to deep and shallow groundwater.\nToday, Wannon Water has 14 water supply systems, \nservicing 34 towns and a regional population of more than 100,000. Each day, we supply more than 30 million litres of drinking water to 44,000 customers.\nWe are confident in our water supply and demand \noutlook for guiding our future decisions, however we are aware there is room for circumstances to change over time. While our teams continuously monitor water use and storage levels, we also look at potential risks to our services and how they can be managed or mitigated.\nClimate change, bushfires, floods, droughts, a change \nin population or industry demands, water quality events, the failure of key infrastructure, and changes to water markets and licensing are some of the threats that we have considered. Our response and contingencies include long-term planning, drought and bushfire preparedness plans, emergency response plans, asset performance monitoring and investment, back-up equipment, by-pass systems, water demand modelling and engagement with key industry and community groups.\nWe have used modelling software to project how much \nsupply is available from our water sources into the future under a range of climate scenarios specified by Department of Environment, Land Water and Planning in the Guidelines for Assessing the Impacts of Climate Change on Water Availability in Victoria, 2020.. \nOur work has shown that we are in a reliable water \nresource position under current and medium climate conditions, with appropriate augmentation actions identified to increase water supply when needed in the surface water systems of the Otways, Grampians and Glenthompson. These three systems will be impacted by the reduced rainfall and run-off predicted under the climate scenarios. \nWe have identified a range of options to boost supply in \nthe Otway system, including increasing the capacity of the Ewen\u2019s Hill storage by 300 megalitres, the ongoing expansion of the Warrnambool Roof Water Harvesting System, and bringing a groundwater bore at Curdievale online. Ewen\u2019s Hill would be the first augmentation project and this would most likely be required in 2031.\nFor the Grampians system, the purchase of additional \nwater from the Wimmera \u2013 Glenelg System (via Rocklands Reservoir) is likely to be needed by 2045. We\u2019ll also be investigating new groundwater sources over the next five years as the reliability of the Rocklands supply is projected to decline due to climate change and the water comes at a relatively high cost. Deep groundwater sources are mostly climate independent and by locating a source, we can further secure our system in the event of drier conditions.\nSince the last drought, when Glenthompson was on \nStage 4 restrictions for some time, connections have been installed on the transfer pipeline to allow higher flows to be transferred from the Willaura system. There is also a high probability that the Willaura system will be connected to the Wimmera-Glenelg system which will allow additional water to be accessed throughout the year \u2013 improving system reliability.\nFor our groundwater systems, the majority are likely to \nbe minimally impacted by reduced rainfall and run-off due to them being medium to deep confined aquifers with large recharge areas. Our groundwater systems are exceptionally reliable and can be expected to perform to their capacity under the specified climate guidelines. \nEven though our supplies are secure, we are striving \nto be more efficient and sustainable with the water we already have. Our customers are also increasingly discussing a link between water and the impact of climate change. They want us to proactively promote water conservation and efficiency measures, regardless of whether water restrictions are on the horizon for our region or not. Over the next five years, we will be committing to a series of actions to understand how we can assist our customers to be more water efficient and reduce our system losses.\nUrban Water Strategy5 SnapshotOur community engagement work in recent years has \nalso showed concern about water quality including taste, smell and hardness in Portland, Port Fairy and Heywood where deep groundwater is the source of the drinking supply. We already comply with the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, but tap water consumption in these towns is currently below the state average and we want to do better. A business case is currently being prepared to demonstrate the viability of treating the water further to reduce salt levels, improving health outcomes and reducing the financial impacts on households and local industry.\nWannon Water operates 17 sewage treatment plants \nthat treat a total of 28 million litres of sewage and trade waste each year for nearly 38,000 domestic, business and industrial customers. There are three plants with ocean outfalls \u2013 at Warrnambool, Portland and Port Fairy, and 13 plants with lagoon-based treatment systems, all operating under Environment Protection Authority licences.\nThe Warrnambool Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) \nhas reached its capacity, prompting a substantial upgrade which has received works approval and will be constructed in the next few years. The upgrade will cater for the anticipated growth in residential and industrial loads over the coming 15 to 20 years.\nA condition of the works approval is to further explore \nthe options of reducing the environmental impact of the ocean discharge. The options will include extension of the ocean outfall, a higher level of treatment, and reducing the volume of effluent discharged to the ocean through reuse. The investigation is expected to be completed by 2025 following extensive analysis into the options, and engagement with the community and key stakeholders.\nIn the next five years at the Portland STP, we will be \ninvestigating the sludge management process and how we can be more efficient at managing peak flows and optimise treatment plant efficiency when operating at higher flows.\nAt Port Fairy, we will be exploring how we can further \nimprove the level of treatment and make our processes more efficient.\nMost of the towns with lagoon-based wastewater \ntreatment are experiencing minimal population growth, with decline expected in some areas, so we are confident that the existing treatment capacity at these sites will be adequate in the future. However, we will continue to invest in these systems to ensure we have a sufficient irrigation area and winter storage capacity to cater for wet years.\nDunkeld Sewage Treatment Plant\nUrban Water Strategy6 Purpose of the Urban Water \nStrategy\nAn Urban Water Strategy is a 50-year strategic plan that identifies the best mix of actions required to maintain a balance between demand for water from our customers and available supply from the environment, now and into the future. This is achieved through:\n\u2022 Considering all aspects of the Urban Water Cycle across a 50-year planning horizon.\n\u2022 Ensuring that urban communities are resilient and liveable, now and in the future.\n\u2022 Being informed by local integrated water planning undertaken by agencies and authorities with roles and responsibilities across water supply, wastewater, flood resilience, urban waterway health and urban landscapes and spaces.\n\u2022 Balancing social, environmental, and economic costs and benefits.\n\u2022 Ensuring that our future portfolio of water sources is diversified and resilient.\n\u2022 Considering the consequences of uncertainty associated with population change, climate change and variability and future potential risks to supply.\nObjectives of the Urban Water Strategy\nThe key objective of the Urban Water Strategy is to ensure that urban water planning and investment by Wannon Water is efficient and effective. This will: \n\u2022 Ensure safe, secure, reliable, and affordable water supplies that meet society\u2019s needs.\n\u2022 Enable customers to have access to desired water products and services, and to choose to use water for activities they value highly.\n\u2022 Encourage the sustainable use of water resources \u2013 including rainwater, stormwater and recycled water and rainfall-independent supplies - in ways that are efficient and fit-for-purpose, while ensuring that public and environmental health are protected.\n\u2022 Educate communities on the role of water in our urban communities to enhance liveability, productivity, prosperity and environment of our cities and towns.\u2022 Ensure that water needs of environmental assets are transparently considered and delivered.\n\u2022 Ensure that water planning is subject to a transparent and rigorous decision-making process, with clear roles and responsibilities and accountabilities, which can adapt to the changing environment.\nWhere does the Urban Water Strategy fit into the state framework?\nVictoria has an adaptive water management framework for water resources established under legislation. In undertaking their functions, the Minister sets expectations through instruments like the Statement of Obligations supported by policies and guidance such as:\n\u2022 Urban Water Strategies: Developed every five years to outline water supply security over a 50-year outlook.\n\u2022 Drought Preparedness Plans: Developed every five years (or within 12 months of either the lifting of any period of water restrictions or the augmentation of any water supply system) to define timely and effective preparation and response to anticipated water shortages. \n\u2022 Annual Water Outlooks: To report upon each supply system\u2019s ability to provide sufficient water security in the short term. \n\u2022 Emergency Management Plans: To respond to emergencies such as bushfires, blue-green algae outbreaks, and other water quality incidents.\nWannon Water\u2019s strategic intent\nWannon Water is dedicated to improving the lives of those who live in our service region. The Urban Water Strategy is a platform for us to commit to actions that ensure we are providing value for money services for our customers and achieve our overarching corporate goal of delivering water and sewerage services while improving the lives of people in South West Victoria as shown in figure 1 (next page). What is an Urban Water \nStrategy?\nUrban Water Strategy7 \nFigure 1 - Wannon Water\u2019s strategic intent\nUrban Water Strategy8 Snapshot\nWannon Water supplies around 14,000 megalitres of water to \ncustomers each year. \nOur 23,500-square-kilometre region is divided into 34 drinking water localities and various non-drinking water areas. The water comes from a diverse array of sources, including protected forested catchments, agricultural land, plantation forests and groundwater aquifers.\nWe hold bulk entitlements issued by the Minister \nfor Water to extract surface water and take and use licenses administered through Southern Rural Water for groundwater extraction. The water we extract is transported from the source to treatment plants where it is treated to safe standards laid out in the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines. The water is then passed through our extensive supply network in each of our townships so our customers can access this water direct from their tap.

This section details several of our focus areas and recent achievements.\nIntegrated Water Management (IWM)\nBetter planning outcomes are achieved by working together to achieve a common goal \u2013 this is the objective of Integrated Water Management (IWM). \nWe\u2019ve played a significant leadership role with \nDELWP in supporting the Great South Coast IWM Forum. Established in 2018, the forum includes members representing local government, catchment management authorities (CMAs), Traditional Owner, state government and Deakin University senior executive representatives from across the region. The forum has committed its best endeavors to achieving its vision: Water is life - we will work together with our communities to deliver integrated water outcomes contributing to the resilience of our environment, culture, and economy. \nA regional IWM practitioner network operates in parallel \nto the forum, comprising key managerial and technical staff from the member organisations who drive the implementation of projects to achieve the forum\u2019s vision. \nFifteen project opportunities were identified to achieve \nthe following outcome areas:\n\u2022 Safe, secure and affordable supplies in an uncertain future. \n\u2022 Effective and affordable wastewater systems. \n\u2022 Avoided or minimised existing and future flood risks. \n\u2022 Healthy and valued waterways and marine environments.\n\u2022 Healthy and valued landscapes. \n\u2022 Community values are reflected in place-based planning. \n\u2022 Jobs, economic benefits, and innovation.\nThe following collaborative projects have been initiated across the region:\nAlbert Park IWM Plan - The first process of this kind \nundertaken in the region involving government and community stakeholders. Several opportunities were identified for the significant passive recreation and sporting precinct including Warrnambool\u2019s largest secondary school and a community garden. The plan is well into its implementation phase, with three of the projects from the plan progressing. \nAlbert Park Centralised Roof Water Harvesting Project \n- retro-fitting roof water harvesting infrastructure to community buildings on the north-west side of the Albert Park precinct for transfer to our Warrnambool Water Treatment Plant. Establishing this new, very local catchment for water supply will reduce extractions from the environment for potable use and reduce stormwater flows with associated flooding and stream health impacts. A cross-agency project team is overseeing the design and construction of this scheme. \nJapan Street IWM construction - The diversion of \nstormwater from the residential catchment to the south on the park has progressed to detailed design and costing. This project aims to redirect stormwater from the over-burdened stormwater network for transfer to the public open space along the southern boundary of Albert Park for natural infiltration along vegetated swales, providing amenity, native habitat, and groundwater recharge.\nGreat South Coast Urban Water Atlas - A project \nspanning five councils supporting a GIS-based process for data sharing of water consumption, identification of potential alternative water sources, and opportunities to build greater climate resilience. A process for ongoing data sharing was developed with commitment from responsible agencies. \nHamilton IWM Plan - A collaborative process across \nwhole of council, other agency stakeholders and the community that produced a water balance for the city. Concept designs and costings were produced for four priority initiatives relating to water security, diversity of water supply sources, economic development, and improving water quality in Lake Hamilton.\nGreat South Coast Urban Drainage Community of \nPractice \u2013 This group, comprising drainage engineers, asset managers, sustainability officers and river health officers from councils, CMAs and Wannon Water met several times. Peer-to-peer relationships were formed and opportunities were identified for coordination across the region to deliver better value for our communities with collaborative water management. An action plan was developed for future opportunities.Planning for a secure \nwater future\nUrban Water Strategy12 Enabling IWM in development planning \u2013 This project \naims to facilitate developer uptake of integrated water planning for green-field developments. Wannon Water has led discussions with local government and developers in our region to draft a project proposal for this work that will have relevance for regional development across the state.\nAdaptive Wastewater for Small Towns \u2013 This \nproject tackles the issue of inadequate domestic wastewater systems in unsewered towns. An adaptive, neighborhood-scale cluster approach for wastewater treatment in Penshurst has been proposed, with concept design and a cost benefit analysis complete. A pilot project to construct one of the neighborhood clusters is being planned in collaboration with key agency stakeholders, with a view to expanding and servicing the whole town. \nNon-revenue water\nNon-revenue water is water that enters customer districts but cannot be accounted for through customer meters. Customer districts begin at the outlet of the water treatment plant or the branch off a trunk pipeline, or are nominated between locations along trunk pipelines. Every customer district (except rural districts on trunk pipelines) has its own reticulation pipe network, which can leak. Reticulation networks are flushed on a regular basis for water quality reasons which adds to the non- revenue water volume. \nThe UWS 2017 set a target for volumetric reductions in \nnon-revenue water from 2015/16 levels. Non-revenue water has fluctuated over the period (as shown in Figure 4 below) with the target not being achieved in a few years, but trending in the right direction to achieve the target of 1328 ML. Much work has been done since 2017 to streamline the analysis of night-flow monitoring to identify new system leaks faster which then prompts further investigation. Further improvement to the data analytics being done in 2022 will allow faster response in the future. \nThe use of acoustic leak detection techniques to locate leaks continues to be a primary method to detect \nleaks. COVID has restricted the availability of these contractors during 2020 and 2021, but substantial areas of reticulation have been assessed. Since 2015/16, more than 650 leaks have been detected using acoustic methods and then repaired.\nAn assessment of the Economic Level of Leakage (ELL) \nwas undertaken for the Warrnambool, Hamilton, and Portland systems. This revealed that the current level of spending and leakage is around the economic level. Accordingly, the plan is to maintain our current level of expenditure in these activities with a target not to increase beyond 1328 ML as our systems grow.\nAnnual monitoring and reporting\nThe best water and sewerage planning decisions are developed on the back of good data and performance monitoring. We have live monitoring of all our water and sewerage systems via SCADA technology. This data is captured and stored so we can review long-term system performance trends and plan any actions if a system deviates from its expected performance. \nSome key data we record includes:\n\u2022 Volumes extracted from our water sources and \npassing through key infrastructure.\n\u2022 Volumes of sewerage passing through key infrastructure.\n\u2022 Pump performance through run times, and starts and stops.\n\u2022 Levels in our storages and sewerage pump stations.\n\u2022 Treatment process performance.\nEach year, we derive an internal annual report from the above data which we use to flag any anomalies in the system and plan corrective actions if they are required. \nBulk water use and storage levels are reviewed quarterly \nand accompanied with a reflection on recent climatic conditions. These reports are key to our adaptive planning approach and highlight how our water \nFigure 4 - Wannon Water\u2019s non-revenue water volumes\nUrban Water Strategy13 systems are performing in real time. Additionally, \nwe use climate outlooks developed by the Bureau of Meteorology to forecast what will happen to our storages in the coming months. Any decisions on water restrictions for our systems or the timing of key actions will be backed by this data.\nIn conjunction with DELWP, we prepare an Annual \nWater Outlook which is published on our website around December each year. The outlook provides an opportunity to reflect on the achievements and actions we have implemented for the previous year while affirming our water security position for the coming year. Each system undergoes a review to ensure it is in a secure water resource position. We also review the commitments we have made in this strategy to ensure they have been adhered to for that year.\nHow to interpret security of supply \nThe Urban Water Strategy aims to define our water security position using demand and supply curves. This section summarises how to read a supply demand curve and the inputs and assumptions that have been made to make up these curves.\nDemand projections\nShifts and trends in water use are subject to a multitude of factors. Key influences are:\n\u2022 Growth or decline in population \u2013 a growing town will require more water.\u2022 Household water efficiency \u2013 households with rainwater tanks, dual flush toilets and/or awareness about smart water use will contribute to a lower average level of township water consumption. New dwellings built to modern water efficiency standards also contribute.\n\u2022 Weather and rainfall \u2013 coastal towns subject to frequent, regular rainfall may use less reticulated water on gardens than towns further inland. Hotter weather lifts the demand for water. Where towns have been on severe water restrictions, household water use may stay low for some time as habits and more efficient water use practices are retained.\n\u2022 Growth or decline in key industries \u2013 many key industries rely on water for their production processes. As their production increases, so does their water demand and vice versa.\nWe have assessed our current water demand using our most up-to-date customer usage data. We then use both the Victoria in Future 2019 population growth projections and dedicated engagement with our key industries to inform what our water demand will be in the future. A yearly growth factor is applied across the 50-year outlook period to produce a baseline \u2018expected\u2019 demand dataset. To account for uncertainty in these projections, we determined an upper and lower bound that results in our highest and lowest demand growth projections. \nFrom this dataset, a water demand curve is produced \nfor each of our water systems which shows the expected annual water demand across the 50-year time span. \nFigure 5 - Interpreting demand projections\n\nUrban Water Strategy14 Supply projections\nThe yield (supply available) of a water supply system \nis defined as the average annual level of raw water extractions that can be supplied from the system subject to resource availability, operational rules, demand patterns and reliability criteria.  We have used eWater Source modelling software to project how much supply is available from our water sources into the future under a range of climate scenarios, identified by DELWP in the Guidelines for Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Water Availability in Victoria, 2020. These scenarios have been informed using current carbon emission projection datasets and developed further by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to directly translate into the effects on surface water.\nOur surface water systems in the Otways, Grampians \nand Glenthompson will be impacted by the reduced rainfall and run-off predicted under these scenarios. Each of these systems has undergone modelling to understand the impacts under a high, medium, and low climate change impact with an outlook of 50 years using the DELWP guideline assumptions. Additionally, a post-1975 and post-1997 step change in surface water performance has been modelled to represent any permanent impacts on our surface water systems following the millennium drought. \nThe majority of our groundwater systems are likely to \nbe minimally impacted by reduced rainfall and run-off due to them being medium to deep confined aquifers with large recharge areas. Our groundwater systems are exceptionally reliable and can be expected to perform to their capacity under the specified climate guidelines. \nFor each of our systems, we produce a dataset and \ngraph that details how much water is available across the 50-year outlook period assuming the system is only subject to restrictions one year in 20 on average. The resulting yield is not how much water can be expected in a particular year, but an assessment of the minimum volume available in the worst two years of the 50-year streamflow record (adjusted for climate impact) with restrictions applied. For example, the high climate change scenario for the Otways in 2040 assumes the historic streamflow record is reduced by 25.3 per cent. The model is run with this reduced streamflow, gradually increasing the volume extracted, until two years of restrictions are experienced over the 50-year period. This results in a system yield of 9,104 ML.\nFigure 6 - Interpreting yield projections\nUrban Water Strategy15 Interpreting the demand-supply curve\nTo determine the overall security of a water system, \nwe compare the demand projections against supply projections to determine key timeframes and events. We overlay the high, medium, and low demand curves with the high, medium, and low climate modelling to determine the earliest date of action and the latest date of action. The post-1975 and post-1995 step change scenarios are both better than the medium climate scenario so are removed from the graphs for simplicity.\nThis graph is critical in informing us of our current and \nfuture water resource position. A graph is prepared for each system and analysed to determine the best actions and timing of these actions. With such a range of alternative outcomes, the question is: what scenario should trigger the augmentation option to increase supply?\nAdopting the high climate change and high demand \nscenario is the most conservative and could result in system augmentation occurring earlier than needed. \nGiven that there is capacity to meet any shortfalls \nthrough system reserves, or by bringing forward the next augmentation through adaptive planning measures, it is considered reasonable to plan our augmentation based on the medium climate and the high demand scenarios. Where applicable, this has been explained further as we delve into each system further on in this strategy.\nFigure 7 - Interpreting the yield versus demand curve\n\nUrban Water Strategy16 Our engagement practices\nThe engagement process\nEngagement for the 2022-2027 Urban Water Strategy \nstarted in 2018 as part of our annual Wannon Water Engagement Cycle (WWEC), and each year has built on feedback from customers and community from the previous year(s). Incorporating the UWS engagement into our annual engagement cycles helps us develop a richer understanding of our customers\u2019 and communities\u2019 priorities over time while minimising engagement fatigue.\nFrom 2018-2021, we specifically engaged the following \nstakeholders for the Urban Water Strategy engagement: \n\u2022 Regional Advisory Forum (Wannon Water\u2019s peak advisory body)\n\u2022 Traditional Owners\n\u2022 Aboriginal Water Officers\n\u2022 Water users\n - Residential property owners / r enters\n - Rural property owners\n - Businesses \n - Non-paying customers\u2022 Property developers\n\u2022 Major customers (industry) \n\u2022 Vulnerable customer representatives\n\u2022 Small communities including Penshurst\n\u2022 Port Fairy, Heywood and Portland communities\n\u2022 Local government\n\u2022 Neighbouring or connected water corporations \n\u2022 Catchment Management Authorities.\nThe feedback and engagement outputs from our community have been analysed and taken into consideration when developing this Urban Water Strategy. \nWe believe the actions identified for completion in the \nnext five years align with the wishes and attitudes of our customers. We will continue to engage and check in with our customer base and, if attitudes do change, we will reflect and make suitable changes to ensure we are serving the community\u2019s best interests.\nFigure 8 - Wannon Water\u2019s engagement processes\nUrban Water Strategy17 Summary of engagement results\nAt a high level there were some stand-out themes for \nus to consider. These are detailed above.\nFor further information on our engagement results, \nplease refer to the full report attached in the appendices.\nLevels of service\nOur engagement with the community highlighted that, overall, our customers were satisfied with the level of service that we provided when it comes to water and sewage. Based on engagement results and what the community has told us, we are recommitting to our current level of service and have tailored our option assessments and future planning to align with current service levels. \nSpecifically, our water services are planned around only \nincurring water restrictions in a one in 20-year period, with no significant increases in water bills without prior community consultation. Additionally, we strive to make the best value-for-money planning decisions which is in line with the wishes of our customers. \nIf we were to implement stage four water restrictions, \nour customers would be subject to our minimum level of service. This would occur under extreme drought conditions. Under these conditions, we would prioritise the use of water for critical human needs and enforce usage restrictions. The volume of water supplied under stage four restrictions is laid out for each supply system in our drought preparedness plan in the appendices of this strategy.\nManaging future challenges\nWhile we are confident in our water supply and demand outlook for guiding our future decisions, we are aware there is room for circumstances to change over time. We therefore use an adaptive planning approach. We are continuously monitoring water use and storage levels for behavior that does not fit the norm. Where behavior differs from what is expected, we question the data, run hydrological models and hypothetical scenarios, and look at shifting timeframes for key projects to manage any rapid change or shift in our set plans.\nTo complement our monitoring of each system, we \nalso look at what the risks are to our services and how to be prepared for them. Below is a list of foreseeable threats to our water supply and the response and contingencies we have in place to manage and mitigate these.Table 2 - Wannon Water\u2019s engagement results summary\nTopic Customer feedback\nWater quality Concern with water quality including taste, smell and hardiness continues to be the leading reason for the level of dissatisfaction and lower perceptions of value across some service regions.\nClimate change and carbon neutralityActions to address climate change in relation to water security, and Wannon Water becoming carbon neutral are increasingly topics being discussed and prioritised by our customers and community.\nWater conservation Our customers and community have continually shown that they value water saving, conservation initiatives and education.\nWater sources Customers value the investigation of recycled water as a water supply option into the future.\nWater restrictions Customers were generally satisfied with the current level of water restrictions (currently permanent water savings rules only).\nUrban Water Strategy18 Table 3 - Managing future challenges and risks\nWhat is the risk? Why is this a risk? How are we prepared for this?\nChanging \npopulations and industryA sudden change in population or key industry can greatly affect the total water consumed or loading on our sewerage services. The water demand modelling we use for forecasting water supply is based on population forecasts from the Victoria in Future 2019 dataset which is informed by the latest census data for our townships. We specifically engage with our key industry and community groups to understand their changing needs and account for these in our planning processes. \nClimate change and variabilityThe water industry is set to be greatly impacted by climate change, however not all the effects have been fully researched. Therefore, there is a risk that our planning measures today, while using the most up-to-date science, will be incorrect in the future if circumstances or science research change. We use the latest datasets, science and guidance on climate change when understanding the impacts to our water and sewerage supplies. The Guidelines for Assessing the Impacts of Climate Change have been used in this strategy to ensure we have the most current climate datasets consistent with governing bodies across Victoria. \nBushfires In a drying climate, the frequency of high-risk bushfire seasons increases. Some of our critical infrastructure required for water supply lies within forested and isolated areas. Therefore, there is a risk that a bushfire could pass through our catchments and sites, causing loss of access and site operation.We have several bushfire preparedness plans as well as emergency recovery plans of our major infrastructure. If a bushfire occurs, we are well placed to respond accordingly.\nWater quality eventsCircumstances within our water catchments and storages can change due to external events that could lead to contamination of our water e.g. blue green algae outbreaks, bushfires impacting water quality etc. We have installed bypass systems on major storages which allow us to isolate poor quality water while maintaining supply. Additionally, we have a range of alternative supply arrangements for our systems which can be implemented in case of an emergency. We would never allow unsafe drinking water to pass through to tap without issuing a boiled water notice as a minimum. \nChanges to water markets and licensingWe currently hold many different surface water and ground water entitlements which are the foundation of our water supply systems. If the regulations and licensing regulations change, the conditions of our water supply and available volumes could also change.We are intricately linked to our regulating bodies of Southern Rural Water and DELWP. By participating in open engagement and communication with these bodies, we believe that decisions regarding our licensing will be made with our input.\nFailure of key infrastructureWe are reliant on our infrastructure to get water from source to tap, and sewage to the treatment plants. If a key piece of infrastructure along the journey fails (e.g. through a power outage, burst pipe, loss of storage etc), we could lose the ability to provide services.Our dedicated asset management team monitors the performance of our key assets and identifies when key infrastructure is due for repair or replacement. Additionally, much of our key infrastructure has back-up equipment, emergency power generators and diverse supply arrangements to ensure the resilience of our water supply and sewerage systems.\nExtreme wet periods and floodingBy their nature, sewerage pump stations are at the lowest areas of towns meaning they are at risk of flooding. Access to other infrastructure may be impacted by extreme run-off or flooding.We have a number of emergency response plans that deal with flooding events and a good operational awareness of sites at risk. Our preparedness for such events is achieved through regular emergency exercises and climate adaptation planning.\nDroughts and dry periodsIn the water industry, no system is drought proof. When drought or extended periods of dry weather occur, it is likely that demand will exceed our supply due to reduced water availability from the environment. This results in lowered storage levels that threaten to run empty if no action is taken.Good long-term planning that takes account of the drying climate is undertaken in the preparation of this UWS to determine when augmentation of systems needs to occur. Drought preparedness plans have been updated to ensure they are still appropriate. These allow for an appropriate level of restrictions to be applied as available water diminishes.\nUrban Water Strategy19 Augmentation options\nAugmentation options for the Otway and Grampians \nsupplies are described in the following tables. The timing of these is discussed in Sections 5 \u2013 7 as part of the review of the supply and demand for each system. \nAugmentation options identified in the last strategy \nhave been reviewed for relevance and, where appropriate, updated to reflect current costs. For the Otway System, the options assessment conducted in 2012 remains appropriate and only the shortlisted options are described here.  \nThe cost of each option is expressed in $NPV/ML (net \npresent value of option per megalitre). Net present value is a financial assessment that allows the capital and operating costs over the life of the project to be expressed as a single value in current day dollars. The assessment is done over a 50-year period using a discount rate of 3.12 per cent - aligning with the current Wannon Water regulatory rate of return. The number of megalitres is the sum of all megalitres over the 50-year period.\nFor each of the options, purchase of \u2018green power\u2019 was \nallowed to account for our commitment to be carbon neutral by 2040.The robust sustainability assessment that was completed for these options in 2007 is still considered relevant to this strategy. The assessment of options was undertaken by an environmental sustainability panel composed of groundwater management, catchment and river health representatives, a municipal sustainability officer, a senior EPA manager and a regional DELWP manager (with minority Wannon Water officer involvement). \nThe options were assessed against the following \nsustainability criteria: \n\u2022 Cost per megalitre\n\u2022 Effect on regional GDP and development\n\u2022 Greenhouse gas emissions\n\u2022 Impact on environmental flow objectives\n\u2022 Impact on surface water, groundwater and marine water quality\n\u2022 Effect on terrestrial ecosystems, cultural heritage and recreational values\n\u2022 Social acceptability\n\u2022 Distribution of costs and benefits\n\u2022 Confidence of success.  \nEwen\u2019s Hill storage east of Terang\nUrban Water Strategy20 NOTES: The column for $NPV/ML includes allowing for the use of \u2018green power\u2019 using additional cost of 5 cents/kWhr.

Enlargement of Ewen\u2019s Hill storage is planned in 2031 to provide the additional balancing storage.

Supply to Warrnambool, Koroit and Allansford is augmented by a shallow groundwater borefield adjacent to the Warrnambool Water Treatment Plant at Albert Park contributing approximately 9 per cent of the supplied water.  The Otway supply to Mortlake is shandied with 17 per cent groundwater from bores in Prentices Lane Mortlake (Absaloms bore).\nIn addition to urban supplies, there are close to \n1,000 rural connections to the North Otway pipeline. Approximately 460 services supply farms and the small rural communities of Carlisle, Carpendeit, Cudgee and Garvoc direct from the North Otway pipeline. The Camperdown (Otway) Rural District is an area mostly to the north and west of Camperdown providing around 400 services with a domestic, stock and dairy supply. This reticulated system is supplied by pipeline from the Camperdown Water Treatment Plant.\nAs of 2021, there are no permanent connections to the \nSouth Otway pipeline.  \nDiversions from the Gellibrand River at Carlisle and \nextractions from the Carlisle River bores are used to supplement flows from Arkins Creek into the North Otway pipeline. The maximum capacity of the North Otway pipeline is 22.5 ML/day, and the maximum capacity of the South Otway pipeline is 21.5 ML/day.\nThe borefield at Carlisle River is licensed for a maximum \ndaily extraction of 6 ML/day. This enables diversions from the Gellibrand River to be partly or completely replaced by bore water during a river contamination event or diversion limitation as part of the flow sharing rules. The groundwater licence entitles Wannon Water to a maximum annual extraction of 1,800 ML.\nThe Albert Park borefield has a groundwater licence of \n750 ML pa, and extraction of about 400 ML per year. The Mortlake bore has a groundwater licence of 295 ML pa, and extraction of about 24 ML per year.Water storages located throughout the system (summarised in Table 12) are used to balance supply during peak periods. The active on-line storage is equivalent to less than 20 per cent of the average annual demand. Consequently, during the peak summer demand period when storages are drawn down, less than one month of unrestricted demand may be available in storage. The operational trigger for drought response in the Otway system is a set of restriction rule curves based on total storage in the system, including all the storages listed in Table 7.\nTable 6 - Otway system groundwater and Bulk Water Entitlements\nSource/location Bulk Entitlement \nOrder or Water \nRegister numberEntitlement \nvolume (ML)Annual \nextractions \n(2020/21)Comments\nGellibrand River Arkins Creek Otway System 1998 12,580 8,450 Subject to flow sharing rules\nCurdievale BEE026252 2,150 0 Dilwyn zone 2 - ermegency source\nOtway North  (Carlisle River) BEE 029488 1,800 5 Dilwyn zone 3\nWarrnambool BEE024155 750 450 Southwest limestone\nKoroit BEE029066 5524 0 Southwest limestone - emergency source\nMortlake BEE030858 295 21 Newer volcanics\nTable 7 - Otway system storages\nStorage name Volume (ML)\nSimpson storage 34\nDonald\u2019s Hill storage 207\nCobden basin 51\nEwen\u2019s Hill storage 625\nTank Hill reservoir 774\nWarrnambool basin 611\nPlantation Road storage 100\nBrierly basin 52\nTOTAL STORAGE 2,454\nUrban Water Strategy25 Current use and trends\nThe Otway system provides the bulk of its water to residential customers followed by major industries. \nThe Otway system extracts most of its annual water volume from surface water sources with our groundwater \nentitlements and the Brierly roof water harvesting program being used to supplement and support this surface \nwater supply. As the roof water program expands with Warrnambool\u2019s new developments, so will the volumes we are able to harvest.Figure 10 - Otway system breakdown of customer water usage (ML) based on customer type\nFigure 11 - Breakdown of Otway water supply source\n\nUrban Water Strategy26 \nFigure 12 - Otway system supply and demand curves\nUrban Water Strategy27 Projections\nBased on the yield projection for medium climate \nimpacts and high demand growth for the Otway system, the earliest date of required augmentation is 2031. Experience over the past five years is that the Otway system is not approaching any extraction limits, with many months of the year when pumps are not operating at their capacity.\nThe next major augmentation for the system is to \nincrease the capacity of Ewen\u2019s Hill storage by 300 ML. This will immediately boost the system yield by at least 300 ML allowing more water to be stored in winter for use in summer. As discussed previously, the medium climate scenario is being used to determine the timing of the next augmentation - being 2031. This is on the basis that there is water readily available if very dry conditions occur over multiple years. There is additional water available from the Curdievale bore, which could be equipped within one month, if extraction is limited due to low stream flows.\nThe Curdievale bore supply is the next major \naugmentation proposed for the Otway system which, based on the graph (opposite), will not be required until 2035.\nTable 8 - Otway system identification of augmentation options\nAction Description Earliest year requiredProbable year required\nAugmentation of Ewen\u2019s Hill\nExpansion of existing storage on the North Otway pipeline.

Water is secured by two Bulk Entitlements and a bore licence.Grampians system\nFigure 13 - Grampians supply system schematic\nWater is obtained from the western slopes of the Victoria Range in the southern part of the Grampians National Park and Rocklands Reservoir, fed from the headwaters of the Glenelg River in the northern part of the park. \nFor the southern part, water is diverted from eight small \nstreams and the Headworks bore. The first diversion, on Headworks Creek, has been in place since 1904 and the most recent diversions, on No\u2019s 2 and 3 streams, since 1960. The water flows by gravity through 47.4 kilometres of pipeline to five storages north of Hamilton. The maximum capacity of the supply system is approximately 12.8 ML/d. The total capacity of the storages is 2,714 ML. There are several tappings along the main supply line serving adjacent properties.\nWater from Rocklands Reservoir is supplied to Balmoral \nvia a 10-kilometre pipeline, constructed in 1964, and to the southern part of the system via a 52-kilometre pipeline constructed in 2009/10. The supply from Rocklands is under a Bulk Entitlement Order with the storage owned and operated by Grampians Wimmera Mallee (GWM) Water. The six other Grampians storages are owned and operated by Wannon Water (refer below).\nTable 9 - Grampians system storages\nSouthern storages Volume (ML)\nHayes Reservoir 1,200\nCruckoor Reservoir 990\nHatwichs Reservoir 330\nNo. 1 and 2 storages 132\nTOTAL OF SOUTHERN STORAGES 2,652\nRocklands Reservoir* 261,510\n* NOTE: The Rocklands Reservoir has a full supply level of 195.47 m AHD which corresponds to a capacity of 348,300 ML. However, current operating guidelines restrict its maximum operating level to 194.1 m AHD which corresponds to a volume of 261,510 ML\nUrban Water Strategy30 Current use and trends\nThe Grampians system is largely made up of residential use. \nFigure 14 - Grampians system breakdown of customer water usage (ML) based on customer type\nThe Grampians system sources the majority of its water by gravity from its surface water bulk entitlement from \neight streams. The Rocklands entitlement has been used minimally for supply to our Hamilton Water Treatment Plant. Our licence to extract water from Rocklands is subject to carry-over rules. This means that a portion of the water we do not extract in one year will be carried over to our total available volume the following year, subject to bulk entitlement rules. This means the Grampians system has the potential to take a larger volume of water from Rocklands Reservoir than what is shown below. \nFigure 15 - Breakdown of Grampians water supply source\n\nUrban Water Strategy31 \nFigure 14 - Grampians system supply and demand curves\nUrban Water Strategy32 Projections\nThe Grampians system is highly susceptible to the \nimpacts of climate change - as shown by the steeply falling line in the yield projections (refer graph on previous page). \nAs discussed in section 4.2.4., the timing for \naugmentation is being determined using the high demand and medium climate change intersect which is 2047. After the last drought, when Hamilton was on Stage 4 restrictions for some time, a pipeline was constructed to obtain supply from Rocklands. We currently hold more than 7,000 ML of allocation and carry-over water in Rocklands. This provides a significant reserve if there are multiple dry years with low yields. There has been no need to transfer water from Rocklands to supply Hamilton in the past five years due to good inflows from the southern Grampians streams. Therefore, there is no compelling case to act now to increase system yield, with water held in reserve to cater for consecutive dry years. The next augmentation planned at this stage is to purchase further entitlement from the Wimmera \u2013 Glenelg System (via Rocklands). Other options will be investigated over the coming five years as the reliability of this supply is projected to decline due to climate change and is a relatively high cost.\nAdditionally, these yield results highlight that our \nGrampians system is highly climate dependent, as shown by the significant degrees of variation in the high medium and low climate yield lines. Because of this, we have decided to launch an investigation into groundwater sources surrounding the Grampians system in the coming years. Deep groundwater sources are mostly climate independent and by locating a source, we can further secure our system in the event of drier conditions.\nAction plan\nTable 10 - Grampians system identification of augmentation options\nAction Description Earliest year requiredProbable year required\nPurchase additional Rocklands Reservoir entitlement volume\nPurchase of an additional 1,100ML to be added to existing bulk entitlement arrangements.2045 2045\nInvestigation of groundwater sources in the areaAn investigation into groundwater sources around our Grampians system so we can increase the security of supply for this system if a dry climate eventuates. The goal would be to find a location suitable for water supply. Construction and consideration as an augmentation item will be considered in the next strategy review.2027 2027\nUrban Water Strategy33 Overview\nThe Glenthompson supply system is shown in Figure 17. \nThe reservoir has a capacity of 110 ML, is located close to the township, and has a small surface catchment. Infrastructure to harvest water from a nearby catchment (Railway Reservoir) was decommissioned in 2015 following a cost-benefit analysis that identified its use did not substantially improve system security but required significant works.   The Willaura pipeline is used to supply 30 rural customers and supply the reservoir when levels are low. The pipeline is supplied from GWM Water\u2019s Willaura system. The source for this is surface run-off from offtakes on Mount William Creek and Masons Creek in the Grampians National Park, supplemented by supply from a borefield adjacent to Mount William Creek. The borefield capacity was increased significantly to 1 ML/d in the Millennium Drought.Glenthompson\nFigure 17 - Glenthompson supply schematic\nAn important feature of the system is that half of the demand is from the rural users along the Willaura pipeline, before the pipeline reaches the Glenthompson reservoir. These customers have the same access to water as GWM Water\u2019s rural customers on the upstream pipeline, being from the creeks during winter and bores over summer.  \nHowever, due to the relatively high elevation of the \nGlenthompson storage and the associated hydraulics, Glenthompson storage is only supplied for limited periods over Winter. We liaise with GWM Water in respect of the timing of delivery from the Willaura pipeline to Glenthompson Reservoir. The security of the town supply is heavily reliant on this delivery because the local catchment for Glenthompson Reservoir does not produce run-off in dry years.The Willaura system is managed by GWM Water. The Glenthompson township and our pipeline customers only constitute a small proportion (15 per cent) of the overall demand on the Willaura system.  \nA schematic of the proportion of the supply system we \nmanage is shown in Figure 17. Connections for the rural properties are provided along the 24-kilometre pipeline that connects the Willaura system to Glenthompson Reservoir.\nThe water supplied into the Glenthompson system \nis taken under entitlements set out in the Water Act 1989. Surface water is subject to Bulk Entitlements, and groundwater is subject to groundwater licences owned by GWM Water. The Wannon Water entitlements are listed in Table 11.\nUrban Water Strategy34 Current use and trends\nGlenthompson\u2019s water use is largely made up of rural customers on the Willaura \u2013 Glenthompson pipeline.Table 11 - Glenthompson Bulk Water Entitlements\nSource/location Bulk Entitlement \nOrder or Water \nRegister numberEntitlement \nvolume (ML)Annual \nextractions \n(2020/21)Comments\nGlenthompson \n(Yuppeckiar Creek)Glenthompson 1997 94 3.6 Extraction rate not to exceed 0.9 ML/d\nGlenthompson Willaura system \u2013 \nWannon Water 201258 40 Extraction rate not to exceed 0.55 ML/d\nThe bulk of Glenthompson\u2019s water is sourced from the Willaura transfer entitlement with only a small amount being generated by the reservoir\u2019s local catchment.\nFigure 18 - Glenthompson breakdown of customer water usage (ML) based on customer type\nFigure 15 - Breakdown of Glenthompson supply sources\nUrban Water Strategy35 \nFigure 14 - Glenthompson supply and demand curvesProjections\nUrban Water Strategy36 Action plan\nAs discussed in section 4.2.4, the timing for \naugmentation is being determined using the high demand and medium climate change intersect which indicates that augmentation should have already occurred. It should be noted that there is little information of the stream flows in the Grampians creeks that supply the Willaura system making accurate modelling of future system yield difficult. The reality is that this is a small system, with the township not growing and expected to continue to use around 12 ML/yr. \nSince the last drought, when Glenthompson was on \nStage 4 restrictions for some time, connections have been installed on the transfer pipeline to allow higher flows to be transferred from the Willaura system. This enables the transfer of the required volumes from the Willaura system if there is no inflow to the storage from the local Glenthompson catchment.\nThere is also a high probability GWM Water will connect \nthe Willaura system to the Wimmera-Glenelg system which will allow additional water to be accessed throughout the year \u2013 improving system reliability.\nGiven the above, and the fact that water could be \ntrucked into the town if required, there is no need to augment the system in any way.\nGlenthompson Reservoir\nUrban Water Strategy37 \nPort Fairy\nOverview\nTwo 800-metre deep bores constructed in 2008/09 provide water from the Dilwyn Aquifer via cooling towers and \na pumped main to a 2.3ML tank on high land to the south-west of the township. Water gravitates to the town from this tank.\nCurrent use and trends\nJust over half of Port Fairy\u2019s water supply is residential use, and just over a quarter is used by major industries.\nFigure 21 - Port Fairy breakdown of customer water usage (ML) based on customer type\nFigure 22 - Port Fairy groundwater extractions versus licence volume\nAs of 2020/21, we are utilising just over half of the total groundwater licence entitlement volume. \nUrban Water Strategy38 \nFigure 23 - Port Fairy yield versus demand curvesProjections\nUrban Water Strategy39 Action plan\nThe customer engagement outlined in Section 4.3 \nrevealed that many customers in Port Fairy were not satisfied with the taste and hardness of the water. \nThe taste and hardness of the water is due to the \nsource water being high in salts and carbonates. At present, the treatment involves cooling, disinfection and minor dosing to improve water quality. It is safe to drink and complies with all the mandatory health parameters for drinking water, but has a salt level of just over the desirable maximum of 900 mg/l. \nOver the past two years, we have undertaken extensive \nstakeholder engagement and analysis of the impact of the water on the health of the community, the cost to businesses, and the impact on household appliances. A business case is currently being prepared to demonstrate the viability of treating the water further to reduce salt levels. The cost of this type of treatment is very high, requiring funding options to be explored.\nIf the water is further treated, more water will be \nrequired from the aquifer to account for up to 25 per cent of the water treated being discharged as a waste stream. This will increase the demand for raw water to intersect the yield line around 2050.\nIf further treatment is undertaken to remove salt, the \nnext augmentation option would be to increase the licensed volume from the bores. This is expected to be a relatively straightforward process. The bores are able to supply the increased demand. No increase in licensed volume is required if further treatment does not proceed.\nPort Fairy\nUrban Water Strategy40 Overview\nTwo 1250-metre deep bores constructed in 2008/09 (plus one 1300-metre deep emergency back-up bore at \nWyatt Street) provide water from the Dilwyn Aquifer via cooling towers to a 32ML storage located to the south of the town. Water gravitates to the town from this storage.  \nCurrent use and trends\nJust over a quarter of Portland\u2019s water is used by major industries, with the bulk of water use being made up of residential customers.Portland\nFigure 24 - Portland breakdown of customer water usage (ML) based on customer type\nFigure 25 - Portland groundwater extractions versus licence volumePortland is currently using only a quarter of its overall groundwater licence volume.\nUrban Water Strategy41 \nProjections\nFigure 26 - Portland yield versus demand curves\nUrban Water Strategy42 Action plan\nAs with Port Fairy, the customer engagement revealed \nthat many customers in Portland were not satisfied with the taste and hardness of the water.\nThe taste and hardness of the water is due to the source \nwater being high in salts and carbonates. At present, the treatment involves cooling and disinfection. It is safe to drink and complies with all the mandatory health parameters for drinking water but has a salt level of around 700 mg/l compared to the desirable maximum of 900 mg/l. \nOver the past two years, we have undertaken extensive \nstakeholder engagement and analysis of the impact of the water on the health of the community, the cost to businesses, and the impact on household appliances. A business case is currently being prepared to demonstrate the viability of treating the water further to reduce salt levels. The cost of this type of treatment is very high, requiring funding options to be explored.\nIf the water is further treated, more water will be \nrequired from the aquifer to account for up to 25 per cent of the water treated being discharged as a waste stream. This will increase the demand for raw water, but it is still well below the yield line.\nNo further augmentation of the system is required \nregardless of whether further treatment is undertaken or not.\nPortland harbour\nUrban Water Strategy43 Overview\nThe towns of Port Campbell, Timboon and \nPeterborough are supplied (as shown in Figure ) from a 500-metre deep artesian bore (pumped at peak demand) constructed in 1996, harvesting water from the Dilwyn Aquifer. A back-up bore is scheduled for completion by June 2023 which will provide redundancy if an issue arises with the existing bore. Water is treated at Port Campbell and stored in a 1ML treated water tank at the treatment plant site.\nPort Campbell is supplied via a 1.2-kilometre pumped \nmain from the treated water tank to a 1.2ML tank on high ground to the east of the town from where it gravitates to supply the town. Timboon is supplied via a 16.6-kilometre pumped main from Port Campbell to a 9.1ML covered storage on high ground to the south of Timboon. Water gravitates from the storage to most of Timboon and is pumped to a portion of the town.\nPeterborough is supplied from the Timboon pumped \nmain, via a 3.7-kilometre pipeline to a 0.7ML tank, and then by gravity via a 5.5-kilometre pipeline to the town.\nDemand for water at Port Campbell and Peterborough \nvaries seasonally due to the high tourist population during summer. Some 40 rural users also draw water direct from the pipelines supplying Peterborough and Timboon.Port Campbell   \nsystem\nFigure 27 - Port Campbell supply system schematic\nUrban Water Strategy44 Current use and trends\nThe majority of Port Campbell\u2019s water use is made up of residential and rural customers. .\n \nFigure 28 - Port Campbell breakdown of customer water usage (ML) based on customer type\nFigure 29 - Port Campbell groundwater extractions versus licence volumeThe Port Campbell system is currently using roughly a quarter of its overall licensed groundwater volume.\nUrban Water Strategy45 Projections\nFigure 30 - Port Campbell yield versus demand curves\nUrban Water Strategy46 Action plan\nWe are currently using a quarter of our overall \ngroundwater extraction licence for the Port Campbell system. This leaves more than adequate room for growth in this system and no action will be required in the next five years. There is also enough spare capacity in this system to cover any growth in tourism in the 12 Apostles and Great Ocean Road region following recent COVID-19 impacted years. \nPort Campbell township with our water treatment plant at bottom left\nUrban Water Strategy47 Overview\nThe Tullich borefield consists of four production bores, \nall of which are used to supply peak demands during summer. This groundwater supplies the towns of Casterton, Sandford, Merino and Coleraine as shown in Figure 31.\nWater from the Tullich borefield is pumped via a \n14.4-kilometre pipeline to the Casterton Water Treatment Plant. The treated water is stored in a 1.5ML tank and 2.9ML covered storage basin from where it supplies Casterton and Sandford by gravity. Water is pumped to Coleraine via a 32-kilometre pipeline to a 1ML tank from where it gravitates to the town. The town of Merino is supplied via a 20.2-kilometre pumped main from Casterton to a 0.2ML tank on high ground adjacent to the town.  Water gravitates from the storage to the town. \nApproximately 35 customers are provided with a water \nsupply from the long transfer mains.\nAbout half of the native bush that surrounds the \nTullich bores was burnt out in 2006.    Although the fire occurred in the recharge area of this aquifer, the recharge volumes were not impacted due to the nature of the vegetation in this region (shallow rooted and relatively sparse). The bush has largely regenerated since that time.Tullich system\nFigure 31 - Tullich system water supply schematic\nUrban Water Strategy48 Current use and trends\nThe Tullich system is mostly comprised of residential and rural customers.\nFigure 32 - Tullich system breakdown of customer water usage (ML) based on customer type\nFigure 33 - Tullich system groundwater extractions versus licence volumeThe Tullich system is currently utilising under half of its full licensed capacity.\nUrban Water Strategy49 \nFigure 34 - Tullich system yield versus demand curvesProjections\nUrban Water Strategy50 Action plan\nWe are currently utilising just under half of our full \ngroundwater licence for the Tullich system. Population projections for this area suggest that this region of Victoria is decreasing in size and, as such, we expect to see minimal growth. With our groundwater supply being so secure, and good contingency planning already in place at the borefield, no action will be required for the Tullich system.\nCasterton Water Treatment Plant\nUrban Water Strategy51 Overview\nWe service several small towns within our region. \nEach of these systems is equipped with a groundwater borefield, treatment system, storage, and gravity network. \nFor this Urban Water Strategy, we have combined the \nyield and demand analysis. This has been done on the basis that each of these towns is demonstrating a decline in population, which is expected to continue over the next 50 years, while having significant spare capacity in their groundwater licence. Townships included in this section are:\n\u2022 Heywood\n\u2022 Caramut\n\u2022 Dartmoor\n\u2022 Macarthur\n\u2022 Penshurt\n\u2022 Darlington\nCurrent use and trends\nMost of the water usage in these towns is made up of residential water use.Small town \ngroundwater\nFigure 35 - Small town groundwater breakdown of customer water usage (ML) based on customer type\nUrban Water Strategy52 \nThe following figure shows the 2020/21 volume extracted for each of these townships compared to the capacity \nof the system. This demonstrates each of our townships have significant spare capacity.\nFigure 36 - Small town groundwater extraction volumes versus licence volumes\nPenshurst\nUrban Water Strategy53 \nProjections\nFigure 37 - Small town groundwater yield versus demand curves\nUrban Water Strategy54 Action plan\nAs with Port Fairy, the customer engagement revealed \nthat many customers in Heywood were not satisfied with the taste and hardness of the water. \nThe taste and hardness of the water is due to the source \nwater being high in salts and carbonates. At present the treatment involves cooling and disinfection. It is safe to drink and complies with all the mandatory health parameters for drinking water, but has a salt level of around 700 mg/l compared to the desirable maximum of 900 mg/l. \nOver the past two years, we have undertaken extensive \nstakeholder engagement and analysis of the impact of the water on the health of the community, the cost to businesses, and the impact on household appliances. A business case is currently being prepared to demonstrate the viability of treating the water further to reduce salt levels. The cost of this type of treatment is very high, requiring funding options to be explored.\nIf the water is further treated, more water will be \nrequired from the aquifer to account for up to 25 per cent of the water treated being discharged as a waste stream. This will increase the demand for raw water, but it is still well below the licensed volume. \nThe disposal of this saline waste stream is problematic \nand costly for an inland town where the treated wastewater from the town is used to irrigate farmland. \nNo further augmentation of the system is required, \nregardless of whether further treatment is undertaken or not.\nCaramut, Macarthur, Dartmoor, Darlington and \nPenshurst all source water from a shallow aquifer and hence could be influenced by reduced rainfall in their recharge areas over the coming years. The demand of these towns is well below the licensed volume, meaning that if licensed volumes are reduced by, say 20 per cent, there is no risk to supply security.\nThe groundwater levels will continue to be monitored \nto identify if there is a declining trend that can be tied to climate change. Actions to deal with any substantial trends will be considered in subsequent reviews of the Urban Water Strategy.\nUrban Water Strategy55 Our water systems have shown that we are in a reliable water resource \nposition in South West Victoria under current and medium climate conditions.\nAppropriate augmentation actions have been identified for implementation when needed to increase water supply. Despite this, we are striving to be more efficient and sustainable with the water supply we already have. This aligns with the feedback from the community that we should be promoting water savings and providing more water education. \nOver the next five years, we will be committing to a \nseries of actions to understand how we can assist our customers to be more water efficient and reduce our system losses. \nNon-revenue water and system losses\nWe own and manage a vast network of water infrastructure. It is impossible to have a network that is 100 per cent leak proof and reliable, however we can put effort into maximising the efficiency of our infrastructure. We are committing to several actions that will assist us in reducing our non-revenue water and water losses across our systems.System-wide water \ndemand reduction actions\nNon-revenue water:\nWater that is lost due to leakage after \nleaving the water treatment plant e.g. leaking pipes, leaking meter connections, water theft.\nSystem losses:\nWater that is lost while being transferred from the water source to the water treatment plant e.g. evaporation from storages, leaking transfer pipes.\nFigure 38 - Non-revenue water and system \nlosses definitions \nMuch work has been completed since 2007 to better monitor non-revenue water volumes in various parts of the reticulation pipe network, and a number of significant leaks have been found and repaired. Losses tend to be greater in older systems and where soil types make leak detection difficult. In some cases, better monitoring has revealed a greater loss than previously thought, which has been valuable in prioritising the leak detection and repair effort. Acoustic detection of leaks has been used together with monitoring of night flows to identify a leak before it is reported by the public. Many leaks have been discovered and repaired because of these activities, resulting in significant water savings.\nWe will continue to focus in on non-revenue water with \nthe following goals for this strategy. These volumes are to be tracked within our internal reporting processes as a measure of success.\nFigure 39 - Non-revenue water goals\nUrban Water Strategy56 In addition to non-revenue water savings, we will investigate our own system losses in closer detail. We will be \nexploring gaps in our own metering and data systems to better understand how we can be more efficient in our transmission of water from source to treatment. A five-year action plan has been developed:\nCommunity education and engagement\nA big part of promoting sustainable water practices is to empower our customers with the knowledge to make smarter end-use decisions. Therefore, we will be continuing our already extensive communication and education program. Table 12 below details the initiatives we will be participating in over the next five years.\nUnderstanding water efficiency at Wannon Water\nWe have identified that we are in a secure water resource position. However our engagement results show that our community appreciates our efforts in being more water conscious and promoting water efficiency. \nWe are taking this engagement feedback on board and will be aiming to better understand what water efficiency \nlooks like and means for Wannon Water. Over the next five years, we will be improving our internal processes and data collection to better inform us of how efficient we already are, and where we can put more effort. \nTable 12 - Community engagement action plan\nInitiative Description\nEducation programWe reach out to schools and community groups to provide information sessions on how to be more water efficient, how our water and sewerage services work, and run activities and competitions such as our \u2018Water It, Grow It, Cook It\u2019 competition.\nWater Whys campaignThis is a marketing campaign using multiple media platforms to educate a broad audience on the \u2018why\u2019s\u2019 of water supply. This campaign includes information on water saving tips, our permanent water saving rules, where the drinking water comes from etc.\nSewerage service education campaignLike our Water Why\u2019s campaign, this will be a dedicated marketing campaign using our media platforms to educate and promote our sewerage services. It will include information on how sewage is treated, our licensing requirements, how we minimise the impact on the environment etc.\nInvolvement in Water Night and National Water WeekWe will support the initiatives and material released for the water industry and promote community involvement in National Water Week and Water Night.\nSmart Approved Water Mark promotionWe will continue to promote the use of Smart Approved Water Mark products for our customers through our media platforms.

Links are available on our website.\nEnd-use water efficiency engagement with the communityFurther explained in section 13.3, we are investigating how we can improve in the water efficiency space. In year three of this strategy, if lacking data from the broader water industry, we will be incorporating specific water efficiency engagement items to better understand our customers\u2019 end use, appetite for water efficiency campaigns and rebates, and costings.Figure 40 - System losses action plan\nUrban Water Strategy57 Table 13 - Water demand reduction action plan\nAction Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5\nWater demand data \nreviewReview of customer demand data across the businessDevelopment of customer demand Power BI report\nWater efficiency business caseReach out to broader industry to develop contacts on water efficiency trials/campaignsDevelop shortlist of water efficiency campaigns for Wannon Water using industry dataDevelop business cases for shortlist of campaigns\nPossibility of trial \nrun of an initiativeInternal engagement in preparation for next Urban Water Strategy and Price Submission\nOngoing reportingBulk water reporting and Annual Water OutlookBulk water reporting and Annual Water OutlookBulk water reporting and Annual Water OutlookBulk water reporting and Annual Water OutlookBulk water reporting and Annual Water Outlook\nWe will be taking inspiration from the broader water industry\u2019s existing efforts and creating an action plan of what is feasible in our communities that has been successful elsewhere. Our aim is to be well informed for the next strategy to implement some targeted campaigns. Our five-year plan is below.\nUrban Water Strategy58 Three of our sewage treatment plants discharge treated water to the \nocean.\nWarrnambool\nThe Warrnambool Sewerage System is the largest of our \nsewer systems, servicing a total population of around 34,615 (VIF 2019), comprising residential customers, commercial customers, and a number of large individual trade waste customers. The Warrnambool Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) treats all wastewater collected from Warrnambool and the towns of Allansford and Koroit. Wastewater is also received from industries and septic tank contract cleaners at purpose-built facilities in Warrnambool. \nWe have an extensive gravity pipe network totalling \naround 300-kilometres in length (of various pipe materials). However, due to the topography of Warrnambool, 37 sewer pump stations are required to transfer sewage to the STP. There are seven major pump stations and a further 30 smaller sewer pump stations (SPS), not including the Allansford and Koroit SPS (two pump stations each). \nThe Warrnambool STP, commissioned in 1996, is \nlocated approximately two kilometres south-west of the Warrnambool CBD, next to the Southern Ocean. It uses an Intermittently Decanted Extended Aeration (IDEA) process to treat the wastewater. Following treatment, the effluent gravitates out to sea via a 1200mm diameter, polyethylene-lined, steel-encased pipe. \nThis pipe discharges sub-tidally at the edge of the \nshoreline just west of Thunder Point. The receiving environment is of a very turbulent nature, with natural formations aiding in the mixing and dispersion away from the shoreline. The current mixing zone is identified as a maximum 300-metre radius from the end of the outfall pipe. The quality of water discharged is of a high standard in compliance with the EPA discharge licence. \nSludge is removed from the bottom of the tanks and \nde-watered using a belt press or centrifuge, which removes excess water. The dewatered sludge is transported to a sludge processing site in Camperdown where it is further dried and stabilised before being re-used as a soil conditioner.Our ocean outfall \nsewerage systems\nFigure 41 - Warrnambool Sewerage System schematic\n\nUrban Water Strategy59 \nWarrnambool Sewage Treatment Plant\nUrban Water Strategy60 Actions\nThe Warrnambool STP has reached its capacity, \nprompting a substantial upgrade which has received EPA works approval and will be constructed over the coming years. It involves the construction of a new influent pump station, a new inlet screening facility, two new IDEA tanks and an additional effluent screening before discharge. The project will also include disinfection of effluent discharged from the new and existing IDEA tanks.\nThe upgrade will cater for the anticipated growth in \nresidential and industrial loads over the coming 15-20 years.A condition of the works approval is to further explore the options of reducing the environmental impact of the ocean discharge. The options will include extension of the ocean outfall, higher level of treatment and reducing the volume of effluent discharged to the ocean through re-use. The investigation is expected to be completed by 2025 following extensive analysis into the options and engagement with the community and key stakeholders.Table 14 - Warrnambool sewerage infrastructure summary\nNumber of customers 17,400 (including Koroit and Allansford\nPipe network 300 kilometres of pipe of different materials and sizes\nSewer pump stations (SPS)37 - Barbers Lane SPS (major), Japan Street SPS (major), Morris Road SPS (major), Dickson Street SPS (major), Harrington Road SPS (major), Lyndoch SPS (major), Pertobe Road SPS (major), 30 other minor SPS.\nTreatment facilities Warrnambool STP - IDEA plant\nRe-use/discharge Minor re-use on site as part of cleaning processes of STP\nYear sewered 1937\nMajor waste suppliersSaputo (supplied from Allansford) - annual volume 1700 MLMidfield Meat - annual volume 550 MLWarrnambool Saleyards - annual volume 60 MLProvico - annual volume 200 ML wastewater, 100 ML condensateBega - annual volume 80 ML\nUrban Water Strategy61 Portland Sewage Treatment Plant\nPortland \nRaw sewage is collected at three major pump stations \naround Portland and is pumped via a pressure pipeline to the STP. To begin the treatment process, sewage undertakes a step screening process that removes any large items and rubbish, which is collected and washed before being disposed. Sand and grit is removed from the sewage via the grit removal channel. \nThe treatment plant uses an IDEA process which \nuses four one-hour cycles to treat the sewage. The four cycles include two stages of aeration, settling and decanting the treated water from the surface of two tanks. Treated water then travels through a UV disinfection system which assists in eliminating harmful bacteria.\nSludge is removed from the bottom of the two \ntreatment tanks and pumped to drying beds where excess water is removed. The dried sludge is then stabilised and re-used as soil conditionerFollowing treatment, the effluent is discharged to ocean under gravity via a 450mm diameter pipeline. The receiving environment is at the base of steep cliffs and is of a very turbulent nature, with natural formations aiding in the mixing and dispersion away from the shoreline. The quality of water discharged is of a high standard in compliance with the EPA discharge licence.\nThe treatment plant has sufficient spare capacity to \nmeet expected growth over the coming 10 years and further detailed analysis will be done in the next five years to determine augmentation requirements over the 50-year timeframe.\nActionsOver the next five years we will be investigating the \nsludge management process at Portland as well as investigating how we can be more efficient at managing peak flows and optimise treatment plant efficiency when operating at capacity.\nUrban Water Strategy62 \nFigure 42 - Portland Sewerage System schematic\nUrban Water Strategy63 Port Fairy\nThe raw sewage is collected via 18 pump stations \naround Port Fairy and is pumped via a single pump station to the STP. The raw sewage undertakes a screening process which collects and washes large items and rubbish before it is further treated. \nThe treatment plant uses an IDEA process, which \nuses four one-hour cycles to treat the sewage. The four cycles include two stages of aeration, settling and decanting the treated water from the surface of the tank. Treated water then travels through a UV disinfection process, which assists in eliminating harmful bacteria. Clear water is then released to the ocean. \nThe wastewater from Sunpharma is transferred to a \ndedicated treatment plant also located at the treatment site. It has the same process, but is not disinfected due to there being no human waste in their discharge.\nSludge is removed from the bottom of the tank and de-\nwatered using a belt press, which squeezes out excess water. The dried sludge is then stabilised and re-used as a soil conditioner.\nFollowing treatment, the effluent is pumped via a \n300mm diameter pipeline discharging south of Griffith Island. The receiving environment is of a very turbulent nature, with natural formations aiding in the mixing and dispersion away from the shoreline. The quality of water discharged is of a high standard in compliance with the EPA discharge licence.\nThe treatment plant has sufficient spare capacity to \nmeet expected growth over the coming 10 years and further detailed analysis will be done in the next five years to determine augmentation requirements over the 50-year timeframe.\nActionsOver the next five years, we will:\n\u2022 Undertake a review of the treatment processes at \nthe Port Fairy plant to ensure we are optimising the treatment of both the industrial and residential waste streams. Our intentions are to explore how we can further improve the level of treatment at this site or make our processes more efficient.\n\u2022 Investigate the re-use opportunities for treated wastewater currently discharged to ocean.\n\u2022 Develop a business case to understand the cost-benefit trade-offs of treating sewage to a higher quality than our EPA licensing. Port Fairy Sewage Treatment Plant\n\nUrban Water Strategy64 \nFigure 44 - Port Fairy Sewerage System schematic\nUrban Water Strategy65 We have 13 towns that are serviced by lagoon-based sewage treatment \nsystems.\nThis is where we collect an area\u2019s sewage and wastewater and transfer it to large storages where it is retained for a distinct amount of time so it can aerate. Biological processes reduce the organics and harmful products over a set detention time. \nWe monitor the levels of these nutrients and adhere to \nstrict EPA limits before the treated wastewater can be re-used, irrigated or discharged as appropriate to the wastewater site. Table 15 (next page) summarises each township and the end use of each of the lagoon-based systems.For most of these townships, minimal growth and, in some cases, population decline is expected. Therefore, there is a high degree of confidence that the existing treatment capacity at these sites will be adequate in the future. \nWe are still investing in these systems to ensure we have \na sufficient irrigation area and winter storage capacity to cater for wet years. Table 16 (next page) details the actions we will be focusing on in the next five years for these systems.Our inland lagoon \nsewerage systems\nCamperdown Sewage Treatment Plant\nUrban Water Strategy66 Port Campbell Sewage Treatment Plant\nTable 15 - Lagoon-based sewage treatment and end use\nTownship End use\nSimpson EPA licence to discharge\nMortlake Re-use, irrigation\nTimboon Re-use, irrigation\nDunkeld Re-use, irrigation\nPeterborough Re-use, irrigation\nColeraine Re-use, irrigation\nHeywood EPA licence to discharge and irrigation\nPort Campbell Re-use, irrigation\nCasterton Re-use, irrigation\nTerang Re-use, irrigation\nCobden EPA licence to discharge and irrigation\nHamilton EPA licence to discharge and irrigation\nCamperdown Re-use, irrigation\nTable 16 - Lagoon-based sewage treatment action plan\nAction Description\nLagoon improvement \nworksOngoing dam safety program to maintain our dam walls at an optimal standard.

Over the next five years we will be implementing data reporting using Power Bi to track inflow and infiltration on an annual basis. \nUrban Water Strategy67 Appendix 1 - Urban \nWater Strategy Engagement Report\n\nUrban Water Strategy68 Engagement objectives \nThe objective of our engagement was to understand \ncustomers\u2019 and other stakeholders\u2019 expectations and views on a range of topics to inform the development of the 2022 Urban Water Strategy, our 50-year water and sewerage strategic plan. We have taken an iterative approach to engagement since 2018, and our objectives have been not only to engage, but also to educate on the following topics which align with the Department of Environment, Land, Water, and Planning (DELWP) guidelines for the development of Urban Water Strategies:\n\u2022 Values and uses of water\n\u2022 Appropriate levels of service and willingness to pay\n\u2022 Drought preparedness and response\n\u2022 Long-term water security (supply and demand etc)\nEngagement approach \nWannon Water defines engagement as \u201ca genuine process of working with people to build capacity, strengthen relationships and inform decisions\u201d. Our engagement work is guided by our community engagement framework. Aligned to the International Association of Public Participation (IAP2) principles and approach, this framework requires each engagement to follow a specific process (see below). \nIn this process we agree on the purpose of our \nengagement; seek to understand those with whom we want to engage; design an appropriate engagement including appropriate engagement tools and approaches; deliver engagement, review information; and provide feedback on the outcomes and then learn from the process. Like all our engagements, engagement for the Urban Water Strategy has followed this process. \nEngagement for the 2022 Urban Water Strategy \nstarted in 2018 as part of our annual Wannon Water Engagement Cycle (WWEC), and each year has built on the feedback from customers and community from the previous year(s). Incorporating this engagement into our annual engagement cycles helps us to develop a richer understanding of our customers\u2019 and communities\u2019 priorities over time while minimising engagement fatigue. \nEngagement undertaken to inform our Price Submission \n(2018-2023 and 2023-2028), which sets our activities, investments and maximum customer prices for each five-year regulatory period, has also contributed to this Urban Water Strategy Engagement Report.  \nWannon Water Engagement Cycle (WWEC)\nThe WWEC is an annual process that ensures customers, stakeholders and community members can provide valuable input and advice to help inform our decision-making, quality improvement and annual Corporate Plan. \nThe WWEC builds on what we learnt from the 2018-\n2023 Price Submission engagement and ensures that engagement is an ongoing process within the organisation. \nIt supports sound governance and recognises \nthe capacity for Wannon Water to produce better outcomes for our region. It also delivers on on our customer promise that we will \u201cbe responsive and willing to adapt as their needs change\u201d. \n\nUrban Water Strategy69 Stakeholder groups  \nFeedback is sought annually from south-west \nstakeholders to ensure the diversity of our region is represented in the WWEC.\nFrom 2018 \u2013 2021, we specifically engaged the \nfollowing stakeholders for the Urban Water Strategy engagement: \n\u2022 Regional Advisory Forum (Wannon Water\u2019s peak advisory body)\n\u2022 Traditional Owners\n\u2022 Aboriginal Water Officers\n\u2022 Water users\n - Residential property owners / r enters\n - Rural property owners\n - Businesses \n - Non-paying customers\u2022 Property developers\n\u2022 Major customers (industry) \n\u2022 Vulnerable customer representatives\n\u2022 Small communities including Penshurst\n\u2022 Port Fairy, Heywood and Portland communities\n\u2022 Local government\n\u2022 Neighbouring or connected water corporations \n\u2022 Catchment Management Authorities.\nEngagement methods\nOur engagement has been planned each year (2018-2021) to gather customer and stakeholder input to inform the Urban Water Strategy development. \nA detailed engagement plan for 2021 has been \nprepared.

The surveys have checked in with customers how we are performing in relation to our key performance indicators, including levels of service and customer satisfaction. Overall satisfaction with Wannon Water increased from 2018 to 2020 (89% - 92%), but decreased in 2021 (87%). \nUrban Water Strategy74 Water quality\nIn 2021, 76% of customers said they drink the water \nthey receive from Wannon Water, and almost all customers who drink the water were satisfied with the water quality (91%). Satisfaction with water quality among those who drink our water has remained stable over time. \nIn 2021, water quality emerged as one of the key drivers \nfor satisfaction in comparison to previous years (in addition to value for money and customer service). \nOver the years, results have consistently shown that \nthere is a significant disparity in quality of water across our five service areas, with lower levels of tap water consumption in Area 1 (Portland, Heywood and Port Fairy) and Area 5 (Dartmoor, Casterton, Coleraine, Macarthur, Merino and Sandford), where more towns are supplied with groundwater higher in mineral salts, compared to the rest of the region This feedback has resulted in targeted engagement in these service areas, including the Great Tasting Water Project in 2020 as discussed below. There have been concerns around taste and water quality in some parts of the region which has been key in the decline of overall satisfaction levels in 2021 compared to previous years. A perceived bad taste has remained the highest reason for dissatisfaction in water quality since 2018, followed by undrinkable water and chemical elements in water/hard water/chlorine/fluoride.\nSatisfaction with aspects of water quality - average score  (Customer Value Survey 2021 page 43)\nAll respondents (n=1,238)\nArea 3 - Balmoral, Caramut, Cavendish, Dunkeld, Glenthompson, Hamilton, Penhurst, Tarrington (n=197)Area 2 - Allansford, Noorat/Glenormiston, Camperdown, Cobden, Koroit, Lismore/Derrinallum, Mortlake, Purnim, Simpson, Terang, Warrnambool  (n=664)Area 4 - Peterborough, Port Campbell, Timboon (n=37)\nArea 5 - Dartmoor, Casterton, Coleraine, Macarthur, Merino, Sandford (n=70)Area 4 - Portland, Heywood, Port Fairy (n=270)Dissatisfied Satisfied\nAs has been the case in previous years, customers in Areas 1 and 4 continued to be among those least satisfied with all aspects of water quality, while those in Areas 2 and 3 remained the most satisfied. Taste of the water is particularly an issue for those in Areas 1 and 4, and levels of satisfaction on this have also declined since last year (4.7 to 3.9 in Area 1 and 5.7 to 4.8 in Area 4.\nUrban Water Strategy75 \nBase: those who rate their satisfaction with Wannon Water\u2019s water quality as 0-4Reasons for disatisfaction with Wannon Water\u2019s water quality  \n(Customer Value Survey 2021, page 51) \nSatisfaction with management of service interruptions(Customer Value Survey 2021, page 53) Service interruptions\nOver the past few years, levels of satisfaction (satisfied \nand very satisfied) with the management of service interruptions has improved (87% in 2019 to 92% in 2021). \nSimilar to previous years, in 2021 customers living \nin Areas 3 (Balmoral, Caramut, Cavendish, Dunkeld, Glenthompson, Hamilton, Penshurst, Tarrington) and 4 (Peterborough, Port Campbell, Timboon) were significantly more likely to be aware of a supply interruption (19% and 31% respectively). Residential customers were significantly less likely to be aware of a supply interruption (11% vs. business 17%). \nDissatisfaction with management of interruption \nservices was mainly due to lack of prior notification.\nThey never let me know when they cut the water off - \n2018 Customer Value Survey respondent\n\nUrban Water Strategy76 Water supply reliability and water pressure\nOverall satisfaction with water supply reliability has \nremained steady over past three years. The proportion of \u2018very satisfied\u2019 customers is down slightly in 2021 compared to 2020. \nDissatisfaction with water supply reliability mainly \nstems from bad taste, bad quality water and chemical elements in water/hard water. \nSatisfaction levels with water pressure has also \nremained stable, with 92% of customers either satisfied or very satisfied with water pressure in 2018 compared to 91% in 2021. However there has been some feedback about water pressure issues which is why it remains one of the reasons for dissatisfaction with water supply reliability.\nPressure fluctuation is the biggest issue - 2020 \nCustomer Value Survey respondent\nLow pressures in Wollaston region - 2019 Customer \nValue Survey respondent\nSewerage services\nOverall, customers satisfied with their sewerage services \nremained at 93% over the period. Since 2018, the key reason for dissatisfaction with sewerage services is the cost/fees being too high/expensive. \nIt costs too much. The cost of sewerage alone \ncould pay for a new septic tank every 6 years - 2021 Customer Value Survey respondent\nThere was a strong uplift this year in the number of \ncustomers concerned about water contamination and pollution to waterways (17%). These are the strongest levels to date (5% in 2020 versus 6% in 2019 and 5% in 2018). The issue is of most concern among those aged 18-29 (50%).\nOverall, the customer value surveys showed that \ngenerally customers perceived our services as excellent or good value for money. To boost perceived value, customers said that we should focus on improving water quality. \nOverall satisfaction with water supply reliability(Customer Value Survey 2021, page 50) \nLevel of satisfaction with sewerage services(Customer Value Survey 2021, page 48) \n\nUrban Water Strategy77 Customer promise (2021 annual engagement cycle) Wannon Water Engagement Program results\nWe have promised to provide our customers with safe \nand reliable water supplies (e.g., minimal interruptions, providing safe drinking water to homes and businesses). As part of our engagement in 2021, we asked customers via an online survey if they agree we are delivering on this promise.\nNinety per cent of respondents (n=30) indicated they \nagreed or strongly agreed. Some suggestions for improvement included water quality, water pressure and water taste. \nOnly 51% of respondents agreed that we provided \nsewerage services that protect public health and the environment and 42% agreed that we are protecting and enhancing the environment in line with community expectations. This low level of agreement reflects what we heard in the 2021 Customer Value Survey about customer concerns about water contamination and pollution of waterways. These issues may have become forefront for some people as a result of a 2017 plastic contamination incident at Shelly Beach and the Warrnambool Sewage Treatment Plant upgrade plans.\nIn 2018, we received strong feedback about the poor \ntaste and odour of the water supply (in groundwater regions). Scaling as a result of the water quality (in groundwater supply towns) was also considered a cost to residents, small to medium businesses and industry.  We heard similar feedback in 2019, with customers saying that taste is a driver in perception of value (both groundwater and/or chlorine taste). \nWe have promised to provide safe and reliable water supplies for our customers. As part of our \nengagement in 2021, we asked customers via an online survey if they agree we are delivering on this promise.\nGreat Tasting Water Project results\nThe trend about poor water quality across specific geographical areas was reflected strongly through our annual engagement cycles in 2018 and 2019. \nThis resulted in a targeted program in 2020, known \nas \u2018Great Tasting Water\u2019, to engage households and businesses in service Area 1 (Portland, Heywood and Port Fairy). The engagement findings from this project showed that 75% (n=583 participants) of survey participants in Heywood, Portland and Port Fairy do not drink the tap water, which resulted in half of participants purchasing bottled water to drink at home. \nThe water quality impacted residents in many other \nways, including negative health outcomes, frustration with scale residue on appliances, negative impact on washing clothes, corrosion of appliances and impact on tourism and reputation. \u2026 the health impact is significant too as our kids will actively avoid drinking tap water (at school, kinder, day care, home, cafes, other community venues) because of the taste - Household survey participant.\nVisitors are reluctant to come to visit Portland due to \nthe water taste and are quite derogatory about this - \nHousehold survey participant.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for the environment having to \npurchase water in plastic bottles. - Household survey \nparticipant. \nWe are using this feedback to build a business case with high level options analysis of alternative technologies/water sources and consideration of funding models. We are preparing an updated engagement plan, taking into account opportunities with the Authorising Environment and the need for further community engagement.\nUrban Water Strategy78 Strategic customers - engagement results\nWe have ongoing engagement with our major \ncustomers. In 2021, we engaged directly with strategic customers in key industries in the region. A theme that emerged from these interviews, was that water pressure was a concern for some businesses. Two businesses have installed booster pumps to receive adequate water pressure for their operations. \nThe interviews also highlighted that water quality was \nseen as a priority over water security with a focus on safety for consumption, nitrogen levels, conductivity, odour and the impact of blue green algae outbreaks.  It was noted that open communication between the customer and Wannon Water was valued, especially if there are network disruptions which will impact operations.  \nTopic 2 - Drought preparedness and response\nIn 2021, customers and community were asked in the online surveys and focus groups what water uses they would prioritise if water was scarce during dry times. Household use, environment (to support natural eco-systems) and farm use (e.g., irrigation, stock) were the top three options selected in the online survey. The same results were collected from respondents in the online focus groups (refer graph below).\nAfter providing context about our Permanent Water \nSaving Rules, we asked customers if they were satisfied with their current level of water use according to the rules. \nSeventy-three per cent of online survey respondents \n(n=95) were happy with their current levels of services, while 27% of respondents would prefer to have more water restrictions all year round in order to reduce water demand (refer graph top of next page)\nMany of our respondents already implemented water \nsaving initiatives in their homes (refer graph bottom of next page). \nThe most common water saving options selected \nwere turning the water off while brushing your teeth (89%), choosing to use water efficient appliances (86%) and installing water saving showerheads (70%). No respondents selected that water saving was not important to them in their home. \nThe Water Services Association of Australia (WSAA) data \nfrom 2019 reveals that 63% of the responded (n=98) believed that water was scarce while 30% didn\u2019t not think it was, and 7% did not know. \nPrioritisation of water use during dry times (annual engagement cycle 2021, online survey) \nUrban Water Strategy79 Water saving initiatives in the home (annual engagement cycle 2021, online survey) Levels of satisfaction with current water use according to the Permanent Water Saving \nRules  (annual engagement cycle 2021, online survey) \nThere is a strong interest from the majority of our \ncustomers to learn more about our water sources and conservation. The 2019, 2020 and 2021 engagement cycles revealed that customers value water conservation and education and would like us to proactively promote water conservation initiatives regardless of whether water restrictions are on the horizon or not.

From 2018- 2021, we have designed our engagement cycles to engage customers and community about our long-term water planning. \nIn 2021, the Customer Value Survey indicated that 53% \nof respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with how we are protecting and enhancing the environment in line with community expectations, while the online survey indicated 43%. \nClimate change and water security\nIn 2020 and 2021, some customers have increasingly placed emphasis on the connection between climate change and water security. After being provided the context about our carbon emissions reduction program, 89% of the online survey respondents via our Engage and Explore online engagement portal, and 100% of the focus groups respondents in 2021, were supportive of our targets. \nSome focus group participants suggested that we could \nbe doing more to reduce carbon emissions and our focus should now be on becoming carbon positive. \nI want to see those targets to be strengthened, brought \nforward and made more ambitious \u2013 like moving \ntowards carbon positive - 2021 Focus Group participant \nWannon Water are having a good crack at it and \nmoving in the right direction - 2021 Focus Group \nparticipant In comparison to the feedback we received in 2018 and 2019, the results in 2020 and 2021 showed a significantly higher interest in the need to address climate change. In 2019, results showed that customers placed a stronger emphasis on water security compared to efforts to reduce carbon emissions and believed a steady path towards carbon neutrality was best (rather than going hard and fast). \nWater conservation\nSince 2018, customers have told us that we should be proactively promoting water conservation and efficiency measures and taking a lead in protecting and enhancing the environment. \nThe WSAA data in 2019 revealed that 70% (n=98) of \nsurvey respondents thought that the long-term solution to our water shortages is to reduce water consumption. \nEducation to promote water use reduction was \nmentioned commonly throughout each year. In 2020, we identified there were opportunities to provide greater education for our customers about urban water systems and water conservation. \nIn 2021, we asked participants via an online survey if \nthey value education to promote water use reduction and 89% said they either valued or highly valued it, while 11% were neutral (n=37). In addition, 73% of respondents valued or highly valued rebates for water-efficient appliances (refer graph below).\nWe asked customers via an online survey and online \nfocus groups in 2021 if they agree we should focus on promoting water saving before accessing new water sources. Of the online survey respondents, 89% agreed we should promote water savings before water augmentation options, and 100% of the focus group participants who responded also agreed. \nValue of education to promote water use reduction (annual engagement cycle 2021, online survey) \nUrban Water Strategy81 Water augmentation\nIn 2019, our engagement revealed noticeable customer \ninterest in water security and our ability to secure access to water sources in the Otways in competition with growing populations near Geelong. Customers shared this with us throughout many engagement touchpoints, possibly driven by the impact of drought in other parts of Australia.  This was less evident in 2020 and 2021, but feedback showed there was still interest in securing our water supplies into the future.\nThe WSAA data in 2019 also found 50% of survey \nrespondents (n=98) thought the long-term solution to our water shortages is to increase supply. \nIn 2021, a strong theme emerged regarding recycled \nwater and roof water harvesting. The online survey showed that 81% of respondents (n=37) either valued or highly valued the use of recycled water and 92% either valued or highly valued our innovative roof-water harvesting scheme. In comparison, there was less support for investigating desalination with only 32% of respondents either valuing or highly valuing this option. \nOverall, the 2021 Customer Value Survey revealed that \nmost customers were satisfied with their water supply reliability. This level of satisfaction has remained steady in the past three years. \nOver the next five years, our water sources are secure, \nso no extra augmentation options will be necessary to keep supply and demand in balance. \nWhile the data showed that some customers were \ninterested in water augmentation options, generally customers thought our water supply in the region was secure and reliable. \nSatisfaction with water supply reliability (Customer Value Survey 2021, page 50) \nStrategic customers\nIn 2021, interviews with our strategic customers found 90% are planning for production increases in the next five years. However, they predicted that these would not significantly increase water demand. Some suggested that future operational improvements in that period may reduce water usage. Most of our strategic customers noted that water efficiency and conservation was important to them and some already had water efficiency programs in place. \nAll strategic customers in 2021 were supportive of our \ncarbon neutrality targets, with some open to a more aggressive approach. Most businesses were open to partnering with us in this space and acknowledge there is little incentive for water efficiency practices. There is also an appetite to partner in water education programs. \nDevelopers \nIn 2021, our interviews with local property developers revealed there was interest in a more coordinated and strategic approach to future planning between Councils, Wannon Water and private business (other services providers). \nDevelopers told us that they would like to see more \nstrategic planning to cater for population growth. Topic 4 - Values and uses of water\nTraditional Owners\nWe have an ongoing and collaborative approach to engaging with Traditional Owners in the region. A large part of this collaboration occurs within the Integrated Water Management Forum and representation in the Wata Waetnanda group.\nIn 2019, 2020 and 2021 the Integrated Water \nManagement Forum improved relationships with Traditional Owners, allowing for more support around projects. \nIn 2021, following DELWP advice, we also met with \nthe Aboriginal Water Officers from Eastern Maar and Gunditj Mirring Corporations. These organisations showed interest in how we can add a cultural lens to water management and better align government and community needs and expectations. There was also support for a more holistic approach to water management and the need to bring sustainability to the forefront. \nWater conservation and education\nAs discussed in Topic 3, a prominent theme emerged through our annual WWECs that customers value water conservation initiatives and education. The 2019, 2020 \nUrban Water Strategy82 and 2021 data all showed that customers thought we \nshould be proactively promoting water conservation and efficiency measures and providing educational opportunities. \nWhile much of this data focussed on water \nconservation and education at a household level, in the 2021 WWEC some focus group participants also emphasised the need to encourage \u2018big players\u2019 (business and industry) to save water. The participants thought that encouraging business and industry to save water would have the most positive impact on the environment and water conservation. There was interest in how we partner with these bigger businesses to enhance water efficiency programs.   \nThe 2019 data revealed that customers feel we should \nbe proactively promoting water conservation and efficiency measures, regardless of whether water restrictions are on the horizon for our region or not. This feedback shows that customers value our water supply, and think we should be taking action to protect it before it becomes scarce. \nWater supply\nThe data revealed that in terms of water augmentation projects, customers valued recycled water, the roof water harvesting scheme and having the opportunity to have their own rainwater tank supply. \nPotential of initiatives that would encourage best \npractice e.g. harvest your own rainwater you get a 5% \ndiscount on your bill  \n-2021 Focus Group Participant\nWhile the community placed value on the roof water harvesting scheme, our local property developers showed less support. While developers understood the concept and supported the intention of the scheme, the approvals process and \u2018red tape\u2019 involved resulted in reduced support. \nWater for recreational use\nIf water was scarce in dry times, the 2021 data showed that customer would prioritise household, farm (irrigation, livestock) and environment (to support natural eco-systems) uses of water. However, 29% of respondents also selected the use of water for public spaces, which reveals that customers place some value on using water to maintain our street trees, parks and gardens. \nWhen water is scarce, I prefer water for [recreation] \nspaces for community moral. E.g., farmers come in \nfrom out of town and see some nice green spaces and \nit feels safe and refreshing and it\u2019s not all doom and \ngloom. An \u2018oasis\u2019 that people can go to and feel better  \n- Focus Group Participant 2021\nThis builds on similar data from 2020 which showed positive support for water for recreational multi-purpose areas, such as ovals and botanic gardens rather than nature strips. Though customers also acknowledged there were some environmental and economic trade-offs to consider when addressing this issue.\nConclusion \nSince 2018, we have taken an iterative approach to our engagement to understand customers other stakeholders\u2019 expectations and views on a range of topics to incorporate into the development of the 2022-2027 Urban Water Strategy. \nWe have applied a continuous improvement process \nto our engagement approach over the years to ensure we are capturing appropriate levels of participation across different stakeholder groups and geographical locations.\nOur engagement approach has included a variety of \ntools and methods, to capture broad ranging views on the topics as discussed above:\n\u2022 Values and uses of water\n\u2022 Appropriate levels of service and willingness to pay\n\u2022 Drought preparedness and response\n\u2022 Long-term water security (supply and demand etc).\nOverall, customers perceived our services as excellent or good value for money. While most customers drink the tap water and are satisfied with the quality, there is significant disparity in quality of water across our five service areas which is a key driver for dissatisfaction with our services. To boost perceived value, customers said that we should focus on improving water quality (in specific areas).\nThe vast majority of customers remain satisfied and very \nsatisfied with our management of service interruptions, water supply reliability and water pressure. Most also remain satisfied with sewerage services, however there was a strong uplift in 2021 in the number of customers who are concerned about water contamination and pollution to waterways.\nCustomers strongly value water conservation and \neducation, and more than 75% believed we should be focusing on promoting water savings in order to protect and enhance the environment now and into the future. There was also interest in how water supply would be increased in a drying climate, with customers placing value on the roof-water harvesting program and recycled water options. \nCustomers are increasingly discussing the link between \nclimate change and water security, with the 2020 and 2021 engagement showing a significantly higher interest in the need to address climate change generally and for water corporations to pursue carbon emission reductions\nUrban Water Strategy83 Appendix 2 - Drought \nPreparedness Plan\n         March 2022\n\n \n1 \n  \n \n \n \nPart A  \nGeneral \n \n2 \n A1. Introduction  \nA1.1  Wannon Region Water Corporation \nWannon Region Water Corporation (Wannon Water) is a statutory corporation constituted on 1 July 2005 \nunder the Water Act 1989. Wannon Water operates in an area of over 24,500 km2, providing water and \nsewerage services to approximately 100,400 people across 34 customer districts.  \nWannon Water has developed this  Drought Preparedn ess Plan which incorporates all water supply \nsystems across its region. The Drought Preparedness  Plan represents the following systems:  \n\u2022 Otway Water Supply System including Warrnambool and towns and other users connected to the \nNorth Otway pipeline;  \n\u2022 Grampians Water Supply System including the Hamilton system and Balmoral;  \n\u2022 Glenthompson Water Supply System;  and \n\u2022 Groundwater Water Supply Systems including the Port Campbell system, the Tullich system, Caramut, Darlington, Dartmoor, Heywood, Macarthur, Penshurst, Port Fairy and Portland.  \nThese systems are illustrated in Figure A1.  \n \n3 \n Figure A 1 Wannon Water\u2019s Water Supply Systems  \n \n\n \n4 \n A1.2  Drought Response Plan \nThis Drought Preparedness Plan includes the Drought Response Plan referre d to in Wannon Water\u2019s \nWater Restriction By -Law (By -Law No. 6).  The Drought Response Plan is written separately for the \nOtways, Grampians , Glenthompson and Groundwater Systems in Parts B to E below.  \nA1.3  Structure of the Drought Preparedness  Plan Document  \nThe content of this Drought Preparedness  Plan is summarised as follows:  \nPART A - General  \nProvides background information on Wannon Water and the water supply systems within its region, the \nstructure of the Drought Preparedness  Plan and details from previous revisions of Drought Response \nPlans undertaken over recent years.  \nPart A also provides details relating to the overall legal framework in which Wannon Water manages the \nwater supply systems including; legal entitlements to water, permanent water saving  plans, water \nrestriction by -laws and details of reporting responsibilities.  \nPart A outlines gaps identified in the Drought Preparedness  Plan that should be addressed progressively \nover the coming years.  \nPART B \u2013Otway Water Supply System Drought Response  Plan  \nProvides details of drought response activities specifically relating to the Otway Water Supply System \nincluding:  \n\u2022 Descriptions and details of the system, system demands, system yield and level of service \nobjectives;  \n\u2022 A summary of the previously documented impacts of drought on the system and its water customers;  \n\u2022 Details on specific water supply options that have been assessed and could be implemented during \nperiods of water shortage; and  \n\u2022 A sequential plan of action to assist Wannon Water to operate the system during periods of water shortage.  \nPART C \u2013Grampians Water  Supply System Drought Response Plan  \nProvides details of drought response activities, as summarised in Part B above, specifically relating to \nthe water supply systems located within the Grampians System.  \nPART D \u2013Glenthompson  Water Supply System Drought Response Plan  \nProvides details of drought response activities, as summarised in Part B above, specifically relating to \nthe Glenthompson Water Supply S ystem . \nPART E \u2013 Groundwater Supply Systems Drought Response Plan  \nProvides details of drought response activities, as summarised in Part B above, specifically relating to \nthe water supply systems supplied by Groundwater.  \n \n \n \n5 \n  \nA1.4 Revision s to Drought Preparedness Plan  \nThis 2022 update of the Drought Preparedness  Plan is based on the 20 17 Drought Response Plan. \nSpecific variations have been made to;  \n\u2022 General updating of system descriptions to reflect current information;  \n\u2022 Mention upcoming work with local government to identify priority green spaces.  \nNote that there has not been drought in south west Victoria since 2010, so \u201cdrought experience\u201d has not \nbeen updated.  \n \nA1. Drought Preparedness Plan Objectives  \nThe purpose of this Drought Preparedness  Plan is to ensure a timely and effective short -term response \nto water shortages, with the aim of minimising the impacts (social, economic, and environmental) of such \nshortages.  \nThere are two components involved in securing a water supply which provides the ability to mitigate the impacts during times of drought:  \n\u2022 The provision of an adequate supply system to satisfy current and future demands over a range of climatic conditions ensuring that shortfalls in supply are within 'acceptable' levels; and  \n\u2022 The specification of actions required when shortfalls in water supply occur as a result of drought.  \nThe first component represents long term planning actions that determine the level of infrastructure development required to satisfy specified standards of supply.   \nThe second component relates to management actions that are required to minimise the impacts of shortfalls in supply, which is the purpose of this Drought Preparedness  Plan.   \nThe Drought Preparedness  Plan complements the long term planning process where the short term \nresponse needs to be aligned with the longer term security of supply (i.e. knowledge of the likely \nfrequency and severity of water restrictions).  \nThe aim of this Drought Preparedness  Plan is to ensure that key strategic, planning and operational \nobjectives are met.  The strategic, planning and operational objectives are summarised in Table A1.  \n \n6 \n Table A 1 Strategic, Planning and Operational Objectives  \nStrategic Objectives  \nProvide timely warning of any water shortages which might occur during future drought events and \nto be prepared to deal with such shortages when they occur.  \nDevelop and implement an appropriate action plan to respond to water shortages.  \nPlanning Objectives  \nIdentify all the necessary steps that need to be taken through a drought including identifying clear triggers to instigate actions.  \nProvide a basis for regular reviews of the plan as the system develops and more information becomes available.  \nGive direction for reviewing the plan during and following a drought where its performance can be evaluated.  \nProvide clear indicators to ensure that a reliable assessment of drought status is available.  \nOperational Objectives  \nEnsure that Wannon Water is aware of what stage of drought they are in and how severe the drought is likely to be.  \nEnsure that Wannon Water maintains information on current levels and patterns of demand and continually assesses customer expectations in relation to desirable levels of service.  \nWannon Water commits to providing its urban and rural customers (excluding customers supplied by agreement) with a reliable water supply free of water restrictions on average for 95 in every 100 years.  \nDuring times of drought or water shortage, Wannon Water aims to ensure that its urban and rural customers (excluding customers supplied by agreement) are not restricted in their use of water beyond Stage 3 water restrictions.  \nDuring times of drought or water shortage, customers supplied by agreement will be restricted in accordance with the terms of their agreement.  \n \nA2. Legal and Institutional Context  \nA2.1  Introduction \nWannon Water sources water from a combination of surface water and groundwater resources under the \nprovisions of the Water Act 1989.  The quantity of water that may be harvested is specified in bulk \nentitlements for surface water resources and in groundwater licences for groundwater resources.  These \nentitlements are described in the following sections.  \nWannon Water\u2019s Statement of Obligations imposes obligations in relation to the performance of its \nfunctions and exercise of its powers as described in the Water Industry Act 1994. In relation to drought \nresponse, Section 18 requires Wannon Water to develop and implement an effective Drought Response \nPlan for each water supply system and make it available to the public. In addition, Wannon Water is required to review, and if necessary amend, its drought preparedness  plans as follows:  \n \n7 \n (a) at intervals of no more than five years; and  \n(b) within twelve months of either:  \n(i) the lifting of any period of restriction imposed under the Drought Preparedness  Plan; or  \n(ii) any major change occurring to works or arrangements for conserving water for, or supplying \nwater to, any water supply system.  \nA2.2  Bulk Water Entitlements (Surface Water)  \nSurface water diversions a cross the supply systems are defined in the Bulk Entitlement Conversion \nOrders (BEs).  The BEs for the various systems define annual diversion limits as well as other operational requirements. The BEs currently held by Wannon Water are listed below and summarised in Table A2.  \nThe relevant BEs include:  \n\u2022 Bulk Entitlement (Otway System) Conversion Order (1998 );  \n\u2022 Bulk Entitlement (Hamilton) Conversion Order (1997);  \n\u2022 Bulk Entitlement (Wimmera and Glenelg Rivers \u2013 Wannon Water ) Order 2010;  \n\u2022 Bulk Entitlement (Dunkeld) Conversion Order (1997);  \n\u2022 Bulk Entitlement (Glenthompson) Conversion Order (1997);  \n\u2022 Bulk Entitlement (Coleraine, Casterton & Sandford) Conversion Order (1997); and  \n\u2022 Bulk Entitlement (Willaura system \u2013 Wannon Water) Conversion Order 2012. \n \n8 \n Table A 2 Summary of Bulk Entitlement Conversion Orders  \nSupply System  Bulk Entitlement  \nOrder  Maximum \nAnnual \nDiversion (ML)  Other Conditions  \nOtway  Bulk Entitlement \n(Otway System) Conversion Order (1998)  12,580 ML  \n\uf0bb Subject to flow sharing rules.  \nGrampians  \n(streams)  Bulk Entitlement (Hamilton) Conversion Order (1997)  3 ,435 ML \n\uf0bb Plus drought reserve of up to 520 ML/a.  \n\uf0bb Passing flow requirements in tributary streams.  \n\uf0bb Extraction rate not to exceed \n12.8 ML/d.  \nGrampians  \n(Rocklands)  Bulk Entitlement (Wimmera and Glenelg Rivers \u2013 \nWannon Water) Order 2010\n1 2,120 ML  \uf0bb Annual water availability declared by seasonal allocation.  \n\uf0bb Includes ability to carryover unused allocation from year to year.  \n\uf0bb Includes water available for \nBalmor al. \nGrampians  \n(Dunkeld)  Bulk Entitlement (Dunkeld) Conversion Order (1997)\n2 170 ML \uf0bb Emergency supply for Dunkeld.  \nGlenthompson  Bulk Entitlement (Glenthompson) Conversion Order (1997)  94 ML \n\uf0bb Extraction rate not to exceed 0.9 ML/d.  \n Bulk Entitlement \n(Willaura system \u2013 Wannon Water) Conversion Order 2012 58 ML  \n\uf0bb Extraction rate not to exceed 0.55 ML/d.  \nKonongwootong  Bulk Entitlement (Coleraine, Casterton & Sandford) Conversion Order (1997)\n3 855 ML \uf0bb Extraction rate not to exceed 4.5 ML/d.  \n1.

Merino connected to system in \nDecember 2005.  \n  \n  \n \n9 \n Prior to 2010, Balmoral accessed water from Rocklands Reservoir under the Bulk Entitlement (Wimmera \nand Glenelg Rivers \u2013 Glenelg Water) Conversion Order 2004. This entit lement has now been \nconsolidated into the Bulk Entitlement (Wimmera and Glenelg Rivers \u2013 Wannon Water) Order 2010.  \nThis increased entitlement volume allows water to be accessed for both Balmoral and the Hamilton systems.  \nA2.3  Groundwater Entitlements  \nExisting groundwater licences for water supply bores are summarised in Table A 3 below.  \nTable A 3 S ummary of Groundwater Licence Volumes  \nSystem  Location Licence Number  Number of   \nBores  Licensed \nAnnual \nVolume (ML)  \nOtway  Carlisle River  BEE029488  2 1,800 \n Curdiev ale BEE026252  1 2,150 \n Mortlake  BEE030858  2 335 \n Warrnambool  BEE024155  3 750 \n Koroit  BEE029066  2 524 \nGrampians  Bullawin , \nHeadworks, \nGeerak, \nMcCutcheons   BEE026192  4 1,102  \nGroundwater  Portland  BEE026771  3 6,222 \n Heywood  BEE028970  2 333 \n Dartmoor  BEE032545  1 170 \n Port Fairy  BEE029010  2 1,026 \n Port Campbell1 BEE026252  2 1,009 \n Casterton  BEE022551  4 1,000 \n Penshurst  BEE026146  2 250 \n Macarthur  BEE021944  1 130 \n Caramut  BEE021943  2 50 \n Darlington  BEE021827  2 10 \n     \n1. A second bore at Port Campbell is being constructed in 2022. \n \n \n \n10 \n A2.4  Permanent Water Saving  Plan  \nIn May 2006, Wannon Water introduced its Permanent Water Saving  Plan designed to generate ongoing \nlong-term water savings.  The Permanent Water Saving  Plan was subsequently revised and approved by \nthe Minister for Water in August 2007. The rules in the Permanent Water Saving Plan are designed to \nsupport the commitment  that Victorian communities have made to using water more efficiently.  \nThe Permanent Water Saving Plan sets out a set of common sense rules that apply to our customers \neveryday use of water.  The Plan aims to encourage the efficient use of water to avoid wasting this \nprecious resource.  \nA copy of the Permanent Water Saving  Plan is provided in Appendix A. \nA2.5  Water Restriction By -Laws  \nMandatory water restrictions provide an effective mechanism to reduce urban demand during times of \nwater shortage. Water restrictions are designed to predominately impact on non- essential water uses (for \nexample, garden watering and filling of pools), and minimise the impact on the use of water for commercial purposes, public health and essential residential use.  \nIn accordance with section 287ZC of the Water Act, Wannon Water has made a by -law, titled Water \nRestriction By -law No.  6, pursuant to sections 171 and 160 of the Water Act 1989.  Water Restriction By -\nlaw No. 6 is made using a Model Water Restriction By -law issued by the Minister for Water on 3 March \n2022.  \nThe restriction schedule has been given legal effect under By -Law No. 6. A copy of the By -Law is \nprovided in Appendix B .  \nWannon Water\u2019s adopted restriction schedule defines four successive stages of water restrictions. The \nanticipated water savings under each stage of restriction effects storage response and assists to \nmaintain the required level of water security. The estimated savings for each stage and the associated trigger levels for the implementation of water restrictions are described further in each of the relevant Drought Preparedness  Plans provided in the subsequent parts of this document.  \nA2.6  Responsibilities and  Reporting  \nThe communication of the status of each supply system leading into, during and following drought conditions forms an integral part of drought preparedness  planning.  \nThere are various communication levels and protocols mandated by Wannon Water according to three separate modes of operation, these being; General Monitoring, Heightened Awareness and Drought Response.  Table A4 summarises the reporting obligations.  The operational modes detailed in this table \nare described further in each of the Drought Response Action Plans in the following sections.  \n \n \nTable A 4 S\n ummary of Reporting Obligations  \nMode  Communication Actions  Purpose  \n1 General Monitoring   \n \n11 \n Mode  Communication Actions  Purpose  \n System Status Report  Weekly report providing base information on current \nsupply -demand balance and trends.  \nPrepared for the Executive Management Team for briefing \nand endorsement of recommendations.  \n Annual Water Outlook  Report prepared in November each year and published by \n1 December covering current and forecast future supply \nstatus for each system.  \nPrepared for the Executive Management Team and the \nDepartment of Sustainability and Environment.  \n2 Heightened Awareness   \n System Status Report  Weekly report providing base information on current \nsupply -demand balance and trends.  \nPrepared for the Executive Management Team for briefing \nand endorsement of recommendations.  \n External Communications  Media advertising to increase awareness amongst \ncustomers and the community about reduced water \navailability and to promote water conservation \nbehaviours/activities.  \n Monthly Department of \nEnvironment, Land, Water \nand Planning Report  Report prepared for Department of Environment, Land, \nWater and Planning to advise current system status and \nactions being undertaken to monitor potential threats from \nreduced water availability.   \n3 Drought Response   \n System Status Report  Weekly report providing base information on current \nsupply -demand balance and trends.

Gaps in Information  \nA3.1  General  \nThere are several knowledge gaps identified which have prevented the finalisation some aspects of this \nDrought Preparedness  Plan. Wannon Water intends to progressively work on towards addressing these \ngaps in the coming years. The key gaps requiring further actions are detailed below:  \nKonongwootong  System  \u2022 The Konongwootong System provides a raw water supply to rural users under a supply by agreement \narrangement. This supply is also an emergency back -\nup supply for the Tullich groundwater system. Further \nwork is required to understand the potential supply \nissues during drought periods including consideration for the development of a Drought Preparedness  Plan \nfor this system.  \n \n\u2022  \nRural Customers  \u2022 Develop a restriction policy for rural customers during times of drought or water shortage.  \nAll systems \n\u2022 Develop protocols for the easing or removal of restrictions.  \n\u2022 Work with local government to identify priority green spaces \u2013 see below.   \n \nA3.2 Priority Green Spaces \nWannon Water will work with local government to identify priority green spaces \u2013 playing fields and the \nlike, and to explore opportunities to keep these spaces watered when other facilities are subject to water \nrestrictions.  To coordinate with other council planning processes, this work is planned for 2023 to 2028.  \nNote that Supply Demand Balance at the time of publication indicate that drought triggers are not likely to \noccur in this timeframe. \n \n \n \n14 \n  \n  \nPart B  \nOtway System  \nDrought Response  Plan \n \n \n \n15 \n B1. Otway Water S upply System  \nB1.1  Details of the Otway Supply System  \nB1.1.1  System Description  \nThe Otway Water Supply System obtains its primary supply from two pumped offtakes on the Gellibrand \nRiver and by gravity diversions from weirs on three Arkins Creek tributaries. Water is diverted westwards \nvia two pipelines to supply the townships of:  \n\u2022 Simpson;  \u2022 Noorat;  \u2022 Koroit; and  \n\u2022 Camperdown;  \u2022 Glenormiston;  \u2022 A number of smaller townships and numerous rural properties.  \n\u2022 Cobden;  \u2022 Mortlake;  \n\u2022 Derrinallum;  \u2022 Purnim;  \n\u2022 Lismore;  \u2022 Allansford;  \n\u2022 Terang;  \u2022 Warrnambool;  \nA schematic of the Otway system is provided in Figure B1.  \nThe Otway Water Supply System is supplemented from two groundwater bores at Carlisle River.  Supply \nto Warrnambool, Koroit and Allansford is augmented by roofwater harvesting in the Russells Creek \nGrowth Corridor  and Horne Road industrial estate and by a shallow groundwater bore field adjacent to \nthe Warrnambool Water Treatment Plant at Albert Park contributing approximately 10% of the supplied \nwater.  The Otway supply to Mortlake is shandied with 17% groundwater from a bore in Prentices Lane Mortlake (Absaloms Bore).  \nIn addition to urban supplies there are close to 1,000 rural connections to the North Otway pipeline.  Approximately 460 services supply farms and the small rural communities of Carlisle, Carpendeit, Cudgee and Garvoc direct from the North Otway pipeline.  The Camperdown (Otway) Rural District is an \narea mostly to the north and west of Camperdown providing around 400 connections to domestic, stock \nand dairy -related customers.  This reticulated system is supplied by pipeline from the Camperdown w ater \ntreatment plant. . \nThere are no permanent connections to the South Otway pipeline.  Diversions from the Gellibrand River \nat Carlisle and extractions from the Carlisle Bores are used to supplement flows from Arkins Creek into the North Otway pipeline.   The maximum capacity of the North Otway pipeline is 22.5 ML/day and the \nmaximum capacity of the South Otway pipeline is 21.5  ML/day.  \nThe bore field at Carlisle River is licensed for a maximum daily extraction of 6 ML/day.  This enables \ndiversions from the Gellibrand River to be partly or completely replaced by bore water during a river \ncontamination event or diversion limitation as part of the flow sharing rules.  The groundwater licence entitles Wannon Water to a maximum annual extraction of 1, 800 ML.  \nThe groundwater licence for the Albert Park borefield allows extraction of up to 750ML per annum.  \nCurrent extraction is about 400ML per year, to provide 10% of the water supplied to Warrnambool.  The Mortlake bore has a groundwater licence of 295ML pa, and planned extraction of about 25ML per year, \nto provide 17 % of the water supplied to Mortlake.  These blending ratios have been set for water quality \nreasons.  Both these sources have significant spare licenced volume.  \n \n16 \n Figure B 1 Otway System Schematic  \n \n\n \n17 \n Water storages located throughout the system are used to balance supply during peak periods.  The \nsystem storages are summarised in Table B1.  The active on- line storage is equivalent to less than 20% \nof the average annual demand.  Consequently, during the peak summer demand period when storages are drawn down, less than one month of unrestricted demand may be available in storage.   \nTable B 1 Syst\n em Storages  \nStorage Name  Volume (ML)  \nSimpson Storage  34 \nDonalds Hill Storage  207 \nCobden Basin  51 \nEwen s Hill Reservoir  6251 \nTank Hill Reservoir  774 \nWarrnambool Basin  611 \nPlantation Road Storage  100 \nBrierly Basin  52 \nTotal Storage  2,454 \n1.

Further details on these actions and triggers are provided in Section B1.4.  \nB1.1.2  System Demand s and Consumption  \nThe total demand represents the unrestricted water usage from the headworks, inclusive of system \ndistribution losses. The current (2020) a verage annual demand for the system is adopted for long term \nplanning purposes, including the development of Wannon Water\u2019s water restr iction policies.  \nThe estimated total average annual demand (in 2016) for the Otway Water Supply System is about 10,000 ML/year.

Volumes in ML.   \n \n \n \n20 \n B1.1.3  System Yield and Security of Supply  \nThe yield of a water supply system is defined as the average annual level of total (raw water) demand \nthat can be supplied from the water supply system, subject to resource availability, operational rules, \ndemand patterns and adopted reliability criteria.  \nFor the Otway Water Supply System, the Average Annual Demand that can be supplied whilst meeting \nWannon Water\u2019s level of service objectives is 12,537 ML/a or 131 % of current average annual demand \n(GHD, 2022). At this level of demand, restrictions are required at a frequency of 1 in 20 years (95% of \nyears) and the severity of restrictions is not greater than Stage 3 restrictions.  \nThe estimated reliability of the current demand ( 9,547 ML/a) under  historical streamflow and medium \nimpact  2040 climate change conditions is 100%.  \nTable B4 illustrates the sources of supply and how the distribution varies as climatic conditions change.  \n \nTable B 3 Otways Diversions from the Environment by Source (in ML)  \n 2017/18  2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 \nArkins Creek  2291  2280 2884  3077  \nNOPS river water  2177  1808 1217  1356  \nSOPS river water  4594  3943 3929  4017  \nNOPS bore water  12 16 2 5 \nAlbert Park bores  395 417 450 450 \nAbsaloms bores (Mortlake)  14 23 21 21 \nBrierly Roofwater  38 36 41 62 \nOtways Raw Water      \n \nB1.2  Drought Experience  \nOver the last 40 years the Otway Water Supply System has experienced restrictions during the following droughts: 1967/ 1968, 1971/ 1972, 1972/ 1973, 1973/ 1974, 1980/ 1981 and 1982/ 1983.  The maximum \nrestrictions applied were level two of  an eight -stage policy, over a maximum duration of one month.  \nSince the 1970s, augmentation of the supply system has included the South Otway pipeline (1976) and Warrnambool Basin (1985).  During the 1982/19 83 drought, restrictions were not required for the Otway \nsystem specifically, but were implemented to reflect the serious water shortages throughout most of Victoria at the time.  \nWater restrictions were not required during the summer of 1999/2000, although diversions from the \nGellibrand River at Carlisle were reduced under the flow sharing arrangements specified in the Otway \nWater Supply System Bulk Entitlement Order. Flow share restrictions, reducing allowable diversions from \nthe Gellibrand River into the North Otway system, were imposed between 5 February and 26 March \n2000.  This resulted in an allowable diversion 200 ML less than the maximum possible had flow share restrictions not been in place.  \nThe reduction in allowable diversions combined with increased water usage and increased evaporation losses from storages resulted in some concern that water restrictions may have had to be imposed on \ncustomers in all districts supplied from the North Otway pipeline upstream of Tank Hill Reservoir.  \n \n21 \n Storag es were however able to be maintained above minimum desirable levels. Another two weeks of \nflow share restrictions would probably have resulted in water restrictions being implemented in towns \nsupplied solely from the North Otway pipeline.  \nGellibrand River  flow sharing rules were applied to reduce irrigator\u2019s access to water from 3 February \n2001 to 16 April 2001, and Wannon Water was restricted to an allowance of 17.5 ML/d from 9 March \n2001 to 15 March 2001.  Southern Rural Water placed Gellibrand irrigator s on level one restrictions in \n2005/20 06.  However restrictions have not been placed on Wannon Water extractions since 2001.  The \nCarlisle River bores were brought online in 2001, and have been used in 2001/ 2002, 2002/ 2003 and \n2005/20 06 to supplement suppl y. \nFlow sharing arrangements under the bulk entitlement were implemented in 2006, although there was negligible impact on Wannon Water\u2019s ability to maintain the system storages at the desired operating levels.  \nIn 2007, the capacity of the Warrnambool basin was increased by 291 ML providing additional off stream \nstorage capacity. The Warrnambool Roofwater harvesting project was completed in 2011.  This infrastructure has the capacity to supply up to 46 0 ML of additional water to Warrnambool per year.  \nIn summary, Wannon Water has not implemented water restrictions in the Otway system since 1982/19 83.  Whilst annual rainfall totals in the Gellibrand River catchment have been typically low over \nthe last decade, flows in the Gellibrand River and tributaries have been sufficient (combined with use of the Carlisle River bores) to avoid the need for water restrictions.  \nB1.3  Drought Response Options  \nB1.3.1 Introduction \nDrought response options within the Otway system can be classified into two broad categories; demand \nmanagement and supply augmentation.  This section of the D rought Response P lan identifies and \nevaluates the options that are currently available to Wannon Water to mitigate the impacts of water \nshortages.  \nB1.3.2  Demand Reduction During Droughts  \nSummary of Options  \nThere are a number of demand reduction options that can be employed during times of water shortage.  A summary of these demand reduction options is shown in Table B5 below.  \n \n22 \n Table B 4 Summary of Demand Reduction Options  \nOption  Details  Comments  \nCommunity Education \nPrograms  Water efficiency awareness (showerhead rebates, information brochures), linked to ongoing State Government programs.  \nEstimated savings are around 2-5% of total demand.  Being progressiv ely \nimplemented by Wannon Water.   \nVoluntary Demand Reduction Measures  Self regulated water conservation measures aimed at increasing effectiveness of measures within the Permanent Water Saving Plan.  Water savings from this option are expected to exceed the savings already achieved from the Permanent Water Saving Plan.  \nMandatory Water Restrictions  Option available under  \nBy-Law No. 6. See Appendix B for requirements and prohibitions on water usage.  \nCompliance Officer/s  Additional resources may be required during extended periods of moderate to severe restrictions to monitor the performance of \ntargeted water savings measures.   \n \nWannon Water\u2019s long- term demand reduction strategies attempt to reduce both base demand and \nrestrictable demand by encouraging more efficient water use in all circumstances.  \nShort term drought  response strategies largely target discretionary water use. Recent experience across \nWannon Water\u2019s systems has shown that short term savings can be achieved across  residential, non-\nresidential and commercial sectors.  The current unrestricted average annual demand of the Otway Water Supply System is estimated to be \n9,547 ML/a (including system losses).  Historical records show that demand can be quite variable from \nyear to year.  Generally, demand tends to increase during hot and dry periods when outdoor usage \nincreases.  Hence, water shortages resulting from reduced inflows during drought conditions tend to be exacerbated by increased demand levels.  \nVoluntary Demand Reduction Measures  \nVoluntary demand measures are an initial measure in the event of a drought. The importance of public awareness, understanding and involvement in meeting demand reduction objectives cannot be underestimated.   \n \nWannon Water is committed to communicating effectively with its Otway Water Supply System \ncustomers to encourage take up of voluntary water saving measures and in turn deliver the best possible \noutcomes in demand reduction.  \nSupporting these voluntary water saving measures with initiatives including showerhead exchanges, trigger nozzles and other merchandise, Wannon Water aims to encourage its customer base to play an \n \n23 \n active role in managing their water supply and play their part in times of water shortages to ensure \nefficient use of their precious resource.   \nA broad base of local media (press and electronic) can be utilised to raise community awareness of system supply levels and encourage voluntary water saving measures.  \nWannon Water will raise the profile of system levels and support the take- up of voluntary measures \nthrough extensive \u2018tips\u2019 and media coverage on its website, regular informative media releases, \nadvertising, distributing publications with customer accounts and distributing information at community \nevents throughout the service region.  Wannon Water will also liaise with its Customer Engagement Committee where appropriate and consider holding community information sessions to raise awareness.  \nPublication of information including changes in water usage, rainfall levels, streamflows or bore performance details can assist in raising the profile of shortages  and demand needs.  Recent experience \nhas shown that in combination, all of the above communication tools have been effective in heightened public awareness and consciousness of water efficiency measures, particularly over summer months.  \nAs well as engaging the community in voluntary demand reduction measures Wannon Water can liaise with major consumption customers to work out strategies to reduce consumption.  Major customers include the local shire, community groups, industrial and rural water user s. \nMandatory Water Restrictions \nAs mentioned in Part A of this document, Wannon Water applies a four -stage water restriction policy in \naccordance with the Victorian Uniform Drought Water Restriction Guidelines (VicWater, 2005). The \npolicy defines trigger levels corresponding to the total volume of water held in system storages (refer Table B1). The current restriction triggers for the system are provided in the Drought Response Plan \nAction Plan.  \nThe anticipated water savings for each level of restriction is shown in Table B6. These savings have been tested by comparing residential KL per connection over the period 2005/2006 to 2010/2011 for \nHamilton against other towns not subject to water restric tions.   The residential consumption rates shown \nin Table B6 provide guidance on the level of consumption which should be targeted to achieve the stated water savings.  \nTable B 5 A\n nticipated Water Savings from Water Restrictions  for the Otway System  \nRestriction \nLevel  Estimated Water Saving  Target \nResidential \nConsumption \nRate  \n% of Restrictable \nDemand1 Volume  \n(ML) % of Total Raw \nWater Use2 KL/ \nconnection/  \nyr L/ \nperson/ \nday \nPWSM     160 190 \nStage 1  13% - 16% 90-110 1% 156 185 \nStage 2  40% - 50% 300-350 3% 146 173 \nStage 3  60% - 75% 420-520 5% 140 166 \n \n24 \n Restriction \nLevel  Estimated Water Saving  Target \nResidential \nConsumption \nRate  \n% of Restrictable \nDemand1 Volume  \n(ML) % of Total Raw \nWater Use2 KL/ \nconnection/  \nyr L/ \nperson/ \nday \nStage 4  95% -100%  700 7% 130 154 \n1.

It is therefore essential to consider the larger \nscale options as part of longer term water supply planning.  However, there are several options available to augment supply during drought.  The feasibility of each option depends to a large extent on the size of \nthe population being serviced, the physical characteristics of the supply system and, ultimately, on the \nseverity of the drought.  A summary of the short term supply augmentation options for the Otway Water \nSupply System is shown in Table B7.   \n \n \n25 \n Table B 6 Supply Augmentation Options During Drought  \nOption  Details  Available Supply  \nEmergency \nGroundwater Bores\n1 Curdiev ale Bore \u2013 3 year old bore pump tested \nto 9 ML/day  available for use during an \nemergency .

Further assessment required to determine available supply.  \n \n \n26 \n B1.4  Drought Response Actions  \nSystem monitoring is undertaken to assess the status of the supply system according to one of the \nfollowing three operational modes:  \nMode 1 \u2013 General Monitoring  \n \nMode 2 \u2013 Heightened Awareness   \nMode 3 \u2013 Drought Response   \nB1.4.1  Mode 1 \u2013 General Monitoring (Pre -Drought Phase Activities)  \nThe zone for the General Monitoring mode is defined by the system storage capacity as the upper bound and a trigger which is set just below the system operating curve, as the lower bound.  \nThere are a number of important factors in pre drought monitoring and planning which will influence the decision to declare the system as being in the General Monitoring mode. These include:  \n\u2022 Storage contents, river flows and bore performance data to monitor availability of supply;  \n\u2022 Climatic trends and seasonal outlooks as  indicators of the possible onset of drought;  \n\u2022 Consumption trends to indicate changes in Customer\u2019s usage of water; and  \n\u2022 Forecasting storage behaviour over a 6- 12 month period.  \nThe Annual Water Outlook tool is used to monitor supply and demand side aspects  of the system. During \nthe General Monitoring mode, the system status is updated on a weekly basis and a report prepared \nweekly. A summary of the key system performance indicators for the Otway Water Supply System which \nshould be included in the Annual Wat er Outlook and System Status Report is provided in Table B8.   \n \n\n \n27 \n Table B 7 Requirements for Annual Water Outlook  and System Status Monitoring and Reporting  \nItem Requirements  \nRainfall, seasonal climate outlook  Information accessed from Bureau of Meteorology \nwebsite.  \nState -wide status  Bureau of Meteorology and Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning websites provide status \nreports on rainfall, streamflow, storage levels, groundwater and urban water restrictions across Victoria on a monthly basis.  \nSystem storage contents  Monitored at least weekly and recorded in an operational database.  Data recorded for all towns.  \n \nGellibrand River gauging stations downstream of both the pump offtakes.  Monitoring of passing flow level and flow details are provided by telemetered data loggers.  \nTwo models have been developed to facilitate prediction of demand trends and storage contents.  \nWater levels in shallow ground water supply systems are monitored at least monthly and are able to be compared against pump depths.  The frequency of monitoring should be increased to weekly or daily if a decline in water level raises concern on the security of the system.  \nSystem Demands (bulk meter consumption)  All towns monitored at least weekly and recorded in an operational database.  \n \n \nThe trigger mechanism for actions is the total system storage volume for the Otway system storages, \nusing the D rought Response Triggers shown in Appendix C1.  \nForward look projections of storage response forms an integral part of the short term planning during a drought. Projections assist to anticipate the \u201clikely\u201d response based on current climatic conditions. At  a \nminimum, Wannon Water makes projections over the next 3- 12 months based on its experience in \nprevious droughts. However, seasonal forecasting over three month, six month and 12 month periods, incorporating information from low -frequency climate signals such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation \nIndex and sea surface temperatures, may also be useful in this assessment.  \nThe Annual Water Outlook tool has been set up to enable system monitoring including forecasts to be \ncompleted.   \nThe drought response triggers are an informative guideline, and are not used as rigid bands or triggers that guarantee the implementation of the specified action, such as the implementation of water restrictions.   \n \n \n \n28 \n B1.4.1  Mode 2 \u2013 Heightened Awareness  \nThe zone for the Heightened Awareness mode is designed to provide early warning of a pending water \nshortage. The Heightened Awareness mode is triggered following consideration of:  \n\u2022 Storage contents, river flows and bore performance data to monitor availability of supply;  \n\u2022 Climatic trends and seasonal outlooks;  \n\u2022 Consumption trends to indicate changes in Customer\u2019s usage of water; and  \n\u2022 Forecasting storage behaviour over a 3- 6 month period.  \nThe key actions are summarised in Table B9 (in order of increasing impact from water shortages).  \n  \n \n  \n \n29 \n Table B 8 Otway Water Supply System  Action Plan for Mode 2 \u2013 Heightened Awareness  \nAction  Trigger  Response  \nAction 1  High likelihood that total storage \ncontents cannot be maintained \nabove the System Operating Curves  1.

Grampians Water Supply System \nC1.1  Details of the Grampians Water Supply System \nC1.1.1  System Description  \nThe Grampians W ater Supply S ystem provides water to the five urban zones of Balmoral, Cavendish, \nHamilton, Tarrington and Dunkeld, and also to a number of rural customers located along the main \nsupply pipelines.   A schematic of the Grampians  Water Supply System is provided in Figure C1.  \n \nFigure C1  Grampians  Water Supply System  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n \n36 \n Water from Rocklands Reservoir is supplied to Balmoral via a 10km pipeline constructed in 1964 and to \nthe southern part of the system via a 52km pipeline constructed in 2009/2010.  \nThe main supply for Hamilton  is obtained from the western slopes of the Victoria Range in the southern \npart of the Grampians National Park.  W ater is diverted from eight small streams and the  Headworks  \nbore.  The first di version, on Headworks Creek, has been in place since 1904 and the most recent \ndiversions, on No\u2019s 2 and 3 streams, since 1960.  The Bulk Entitlement specifies passing flow \nrequirements in five of these  streams .  The water flows by gravity through 47.4km of  pipeline to storages \nnorth of Hamilton.  The maximum capacity of the supply system is approximately 12.8ML/d .   \nA 52km pipeline was completed in 2010 providing a connection between Rocklands Reservoir and the \nHamilton System. Wannon Water has a 2,120 ML b ulk entitlement from the Wimmera- Glenelg system \nand receives an annual allocation, which is subject to the flow sharing arrangements in the bulk \nentitlement. Water available under this bulk entitlement is also used to supply the township of Balmoral \nvia a separate pipeline.   Wannon Water can carryover its unused entitlement from year to year, with \ncarryover occurring on 1 October, subject to a 15% reduction for evaporation.  The accumulation of water \nabove 2,120 ML will help provide for years when the allocation is less than 100%.   In dry years the \nallocation can be low.  For example, in 2015/2016 the allocation was only 5%.   \nFor security of supply purposes, the storage volume available in the Grampians Water Supply System is considered to be equal to the 2,120 ML bulk entitlement, plus the capacity of the local storages that are \nupstream of the Hamilton Water Treatment Plant.  Water brought to Hamilton is stored in five main \nstorages located along the pipeline to the north of Hamilton. The total capacity of the local storages is \napproximately 2, 652 ML.   These storages are summarised in Table C1.   \nTable C 1 S\n ystem Storages  \nStorage Name  Volume (ML)  \nHayes Reservoir  1,200  \nCruckoor Reservoir  990 \nHartwichs Reservoir  330 \nNo. 1 and 2 storages  132 \n  \nTotal Storage  2,652  \n \nHartwichs Reservoir was constructed in 1950 and is located approximately 2 km north of Hamilton.  It \nwas constructed with a capacity of 381ML but the FSL has since been revised downwards to 330ML.  \nCruckoor Reservoir was constructed in 1969, with a capacity of 990 ML, and is located approxima tely \n4.5 km north of Hamilton. The most recent storage constructed is Hayes Reservoir which was \nconstructed in 1993, with a capacity of 1, 200 ML and is located approximately 11.5  km north of Hamilton.  \nNos. 1 and 2 storages are located on high ground on the northern outskirts of Hamilton and serve the city \nas raw water balancing basins.  The basins are interconnected and have a combined capacity of 132 ML \n(66 ML each).   \n \n37 \n The five storages are filled by gravity and all, with the exception of Hayes Reservoir, are emptied by \ngravity. Treated water is delivered to clear water storage tanks with a total capacity of 13 ML before \nbeing supplied to the reticulation system.  \nThe township of Tarrington was connected to the Hamilton  system in 1972 and is supplied via a pumped \nrising main to a 1ML tank  located on the top of Mount Pierrepoint. Water then gravitates from this storage \nto a small elevated tower in Tarrington and then by gravity to the township.  \nThe township of Cavendish was connected to the Hamilton  system in 1970 via a 100 mm diameter \ndiversion pipeline from the main Grampians pipeline serving Hamilton.  Water is supplied by gravity to a \n2.25ML shadecloth- covered storage on high ground to the east of the township. Water gravitates from \nthe reservoir to the township.  During summer low flow periods, when all the stream flow is used to meet \nthe environmental flow requirements, the Headworks bore is used to supply the tow n.   \nThe township of Dunkeld was connected to the Hamilt on system in 1998 via a 33  km pipeline to a new \nclear water (lined and covered) storage (6.3 ML).  Prior to connection to the Hamilton system, the \nDunkeld system consisted of three storages, being the No. 1 Service Basin (36 ML), the No. 2 Service \nBasin (3 6 ML) and the No. 3 Reservoir (110 ML). A weir on Waterfall Creek supplies water to the No. 3 \nand No. 2 storages. Although not treated, this system could be used as an emergency supply as was the case in the 2006 bushfires.   \nOperating rules have been developed which aim to maximise the yield from the combined supply \nsources, whilst mitigating water quality risks associated with the higher salinity supply from Rocklands \nReservoir.  Storage operating curves have been developed which define usage of the total available resource according to the quality of water in Rocklands Reservoir. When the quality of water in \nRocklands Reservoir is less than 500 mg/L TDS, the risk that the resource will become unsuitable for use \nis relatively low, therefore water is preferentially retained in Rocklands Reservoir and use of the local storages is maximised. When the quality of water in Rocklands Reservoir increases above 500 mg/L \nTDS, then a larger reserve volume is required in local storages to facilitate blending which prolongs the \nuse of the Rocklands resource. Storage operating curves were developed in 2010 to allow for this.  These curves are revised here to allow some airspace in the local storages to maximise the potential to harvest from the local streams.  The adopted storage operating curves are illustrated in Figure C2.  \n  \n \n38 \n Figure C 2 Operating Curves for Hamilton  System  Storages  \n \n \n \nThe system operating rules specify the usage of the available resource in the following priority order:  \n\u2022 Streamflow is diverted from the Grampians Headworks streams, subject to individual passing flow \nrequirements with a  total diversion up to 12.8 ML/d;  \n\u2022 Water transferred from Rocklands Reservoir up to 8 ML/d with transfers limited to the allocation held in Wannon Water\u2019s allocation bank account (including water held as carryover). Allocations are based on 2,120 ML/a bulk entitlement volume;  \n\u2022 Diversion from the Grampians Bores, up to 400 ML/a;  \n\u2022 The local storage are filled  in the following priority order, Hartwichs Reservoir ; Cruckoor Reservoir then Hayes Reservoir, noting that for water quality purposes water from Rocklands Reservoir is never stored in Cruckoor Reservoir; and  \n\u2022 Hartwichs Reservoir is used for blending purposes.  \nThe Balmoral township sourc es its water directly from Rocklands Reservoir.  The Rocklands Reservoir \nwas constructed in 1953 and Balmoral was connected to it in 1966. Water is pumped from Rocklands to a service basin in Harrow Road, which is located adjacent to the High School.  The capacity of this basin is 0.54  ML.  The reticulation system is pressurised by a multi- stage booster pump station.   \nC1.1.2  System Demands and Consumption  \nThe total demand represents the unrestricted water usage from the headworks, inclusive of system distribution losses. The current ( 2021) a verage annual demand for the system is adopted for long term \nplanning purposes . \n\n \n39 \n Table C2 Components of the Current (20 20/21) Average Annual Demand - Grampians  \nComponent Total Demand \n(ML) Base Demand \n(ML) Restrictable \nDemand (ML)  \nResidential  782 626 156 \nNon Residential  201 161 40 \nRural  63 -  \nMajor  21 -  \nPublic Open Space  13 -  \nTotal Consumption  1080  884 196 \nNonrevenue Water  141 -  \nBulk Usage (WTP \nOutflow+Pipeline customers)  1241  1045  196 \nWTP Losses  40 -  \nSystem losses (upstream of WTPs)  400 -  \nTotal Raw Water Usage  1681  1485  196 \nNote 1 \u2013 Restrictable demand was estimated at 20% of resi and nonresi use based on data collected in Hamilton over the \nMillenium drought  \n.  \n.Climate corrected water consumption in 20 20/2021  for each of the towns supplied by  the Grampians  \nWater Supply Syst em is provided in Table C3.   \nTable C3  Consumption by Customer District - Grampians 2021   (climate \ncorrected)   \nCustomer District  Major  Nonresi  Resi  Rural  Public \nOpen \nSpace  Customer totals Bulk Meter  NRW  \nBalmoral  0 8 16 8 1 34 38 4.1 \nCavendish  0 1 8 1 0 10 9 -1.2 \nHamilton  21 176 687 19 9 912 1031  119 \nTarrington  0 1 23 4 0 28 35 7 \nDunkeld  0 14 49 11 0 75 86 12 \nHamilton pipeline  0 0 0 18 0 18 18   \nBalmoral Pipeline  0 0 0 1 2 4 4   \nGrampians system total 21 201 782 63 13 1080  1221  141 \nFigures exclude WTP and headworks losses. Volumes in ML.     \n \n \n40 \n C1.1.3  System Yield and Security of Supply  \nFor the Grampians System, the average annual d emand that can be supplied at the adopted 95% annual \nreliability is 2,2 17 ML/a or 1 32% of current  average annual d emand (GHD, 2022 ).  The frequency of \nStage  1 restrictions is adopted by Wannon Water as the measurement of system reliability.  A 95% \nannual reliability target equates to a 1 in 20 year frequency for restrictions.  \nThe estimated reliability of the current demand ( 1,681 ML/a)  under historical streamflow and medium \nimpact  2040 climate change conditions is 100%.  \nTable C4 shows the sources of supply.   \nTable C 3 D iversions from the Environment by Source (in ML) \n \n2017/18  2018 /19 2019/ 20 2020/ 21 \nBalmoral @ Rocklands  25 52 43 42 \nHamilton - Rocklands  3 1 1 43 \nGrampians streams  1419 1320 1697 1560 \nGrampians bores  314 256 302 169 \nDunkeld headworks \nweir 13 11 18 29 \nGrampians Raw Water  1774 1640 2061 1843 \n \nC1.2  Drought Experience  \nC1.2.1  Brief Analysis of Historic Droughts  \nPrior to, and including the 1982/ 1983 drought, restrictions on water use were regularly imposed.  The \n1982/19 83 drought was the most severe drought experienced in the area in recent years. Water \nrestrictions were imposed on consumers, limiting garden watering to a hand held hose for one hour on \nalternate days.  \nTo meet water demands during the 1982/19 83 drought the then Hamilton Water Board supplemented the \nsystem by operating its groundwater bores in the headworks catchment.  \nBullawin Bore was re- commissioned on 2 November 1982, (this bore had been constructed during the \n1967/19 68 drought) and operated until 22 March 1983 producing a total flow of 182 ML (1.3 ML/day).  \nHeadworks Bore was commissioned on 19 January 1983 and operated intermittently until 23 February 1983.  When operating, this bore produced approximately 0.7 ML/day. When both bores were operating \nthey contributed 2 ML/day to the supply system.  \nAfter the drought the Hamilton Water Board embarked on a 10 year program to increase the harvest of winter flows and to increase the storage capacity.  Over 30 km of pipeline duplications and replacements \nhave seen the pipeline capacity increase from 7 ML/day to 12.8 ML/day (only 12.8 ML/day when filling \n \n41 \n Hayes  Reservoir ).  Water can be pumped from Hayes Reservoir at the rate of 15 ML/day. Hayes \nReservoir, with a capacity of 1 2 00 ML, was commissioned in 1993.  \nHamilton also had water restrictions for two weeks during February 1990 but this was due to the last \nsection of mainline to Nos. 1 and 2 not being capable of supplying enough water to meet the demand.  \nThis section of main was duplicated in 1991 and the entire pipeline system now has a capacity of 12.8 ML/day under gravity feed.  \nRestrictions were regularly imposed for the Dunkeld Water Supply System during the 1990s.  The level of water in this system dropped to a point in 1998 and the township was in danger of running out of water.  Stage 3 restrictions were applied and a pipeline was constructed from Hamilton, culminating in \nrestrictions being lifted in April 1999.  Dunkeld is now permanently connected to the Hamilton system and \nthe original Dunkeld system is maintained as an emergency supply.  This emergency supply was used, for the first time, during the 2006 Australia Day bush fire and from December 2006 to September 2007 to \nconserve the supply in the Hamilton reservoirs for the Hamilton and Tarrington systems . \nThe Hamilton system had restrictions imposed during 2000 and 2001. Restrictions were again re-\nintroduced in January 2006, following a relatively dry spring inflow period. By late 2006, storages fell to \ncritically lo w levels following the driest spring period in recent history. By December 2006, Stage 4 \nrestrictions were introduced and remained in place until November 2007 when they were replaced with \nStage 3 restrictions.  The level of restriction was further reduced to Stage 2 in November 2009.  \nIn 2007, planning work commenced to augment the system via a 52km pipeline connection to Rocklands Reservoir. This pipeline was commissioned in 2010. The groundwater bores in the Grampians headworks were operated during the times that restrictions were in place (two additional bores , Geerak \nand McCutcheons, were constructed during this period).  Stage 2 restrictions were lifted in August 2010.  \nDuring the 1967/ 1968 drought, the level of the Rocklands Reservoir was very low.  While there was \nadequate water to meet normal demands the State Rivers & Water Supply Commission requested that \nwater restrictions be implemented in Balmoral.  Restrictions were applied from 1 December 1967 and \nwere not lifted until 1  July 1968.  \nIt was necessary to extend the pump suction line in the Reservoir in order to maintain supply.  \nIn March of 1988 the State Rivers & Water Supply Commission advised that in future droughts the level of Rocklands would not be allowed to fall below 5  000 acre feet (6 200 ML) with such water being \nreserved for Balmoral and landholders along the Glenelg River.  \nConsumers were informed of the need for restrictions by circular.  \nIn the 1982/ 1983 drought restrictions were implemented on the 1 April 1983 and lifted in October the \nsame year.  No other operational measures were necessary.  \nStage 1 restrictions were imposed i n January 2003 as a result of the recent ongoing drought.  The \nrestrictions moved to Stage 2 i n April 2006 and to Stage 4 in October 2006.  Stage 4 restrictions \nremained in place until they were lifted in October 2009.  \nA summary of water restrictions since 1995 is provided in Table C 5. \n \n  \n \n42 \n Table C 4 Recent History of Restrictions  \nDate System  Stage Action  \n4/03/1995  Dunkeld1 2 Introduced  \n17/06/1995  Dunkeld 1 2 Lifted  \n13/09/1997  Dunkeld1 1 Introduced  \n26/02/1998  Dunkeld1 2 Introduced  \n29/08/1998  Dunkeld1 3 Introduced  \n17/04/1999  Dunkeld  3 Lifted  \n5/02/2000  Hamilton  1 Introduced  \n11/03/2000  Hamilton  2 Introduced  \n21/09/2000  Hamilton  1 Reduced from Stage 2  \n14/10/2000  Hamilton  1 Lifted  \n27/01/2001  Hamilton  1 Introduced  \n10/03/2001  Hamilton  2 Introduced  \n8/09/2001  Hamilton  2 & 1  Lifted  \n18/01/2003  Balmoral  1 Introduced  \n21/01/2006  Hamilton  1 Introduced  \n01/04/2006  Hamilton, Balmoral  2 Introduced  \n14/10/2006  Balmoral  4 Introduced  \n4/11/2006  Hamilton  3 Introduced  \n5/12/2006  Hamilton  4 Introduced  \n3/11/2007  Hamilton  3 Reduced from Stage 4  \n04/10/2009  Balmoral  PWSR Stage 4 Lifted \u2013 returned to PWSR  \n1/11/2009  Hamilton  2 Reduced from Stage 3  \n1/08/2010  Hamilton  PWSR Stage 2 Lifted \u2013 returned to PWSR  \n1. Operated as an independent system prior to 1999.  \n \n \n43 \n C1.3  Drought Response Options  \nC1.3.1  Introduction \nResponse options in the Grampians  System can be classified into two broad categories; demand \nmanagement and sup ply enhancement.  In this section of the D rought Response P lan, potential demand \nmanagement and supply enhancement options for the Wannon Water are identified.  \nC1.3.2  Demand Reduction During Dr oughts  \nSummary of Options  \nThere are a number of demand reduction options that can be employed during times of water shortage.  \nA summary of demand reduction options is shown in Table C6 below.  \nTable C 5 S ummary of Demand Reduction Options  \nOption  Details  Comments  \nCommunity Education \nPrograms  Water efficiency awareness (showerhead rebates, information brochures), linked to ongoing State \nGovernment programs.  \nEstimated savings are of  \n2-5% of total demand over next 2 \nyears.  Being progressively implemented \nby Wannon Water.   \nVoluntary Demand \nReduction Measures  Self regulated water conservation measures aimed at increasing effectiveness of measures within the Permanent Water Saving Plan, and potential savings if water restrictions are implemented.  Water savings from this option are expected to exceed the savings already achieved from the Permanent Water Saving Plan.  \nMandatory Water Restrictions  Option available under  \nBy-Law No. 6. See Appendix B for requirements and prohibitions on water usage.  \nCompliance Officer/s  Additional resources may be required during extended periods of moderate to severe restrictions to monitor the performance of targeted water savings measures.   \nRestrict Supply to Rural Customers  Possible under agreement only.  A restriction policy for rural customers requires further development.  \nVoluntary Demand Reduction Measures  \nVoluntary demand measures are an initial measure in the event of a drought. The importance of public \nawareness, understanding and involvement in meeting demand reduction objectives cannot be underestimated.   \nWannon Water is committed to communicating effectively with its Grampians System customers to encourage take up of voluntary water saving measures and in turn deliver the best possible outcomes in demand reduction.  \n \n44 \n Supporting these voluntary water saving measures with initiatives including showerhead exchanges, \ntrigger nozzles and other merchandise, Wannon Water aims to encourage its customer base to play an active role in managing their water supply and play their part in times of water shortages to ensure efficient use of their precious resource.   \nA broad base of local media (press and electronic) can be utilised to raise community awareness of \nsystem supply levels and encourage voluntary water saving measures.  \nWannon Water will raise the profile of system levels and support the take- up of voluntary  measures \nthrough extensive \u2018tips\u2019 and media coverage on its website, regular informative media releases, advertising, distributing publications with customer accounts and distributing information at community \nevents throughout the service region.  Wannon Water will also liaise with its Customer Engagement \nCommittee where appropriate and consider holding community information sessions to raise awareness.  \nPublication of information including changes in water usage, rainfall levels, streamflows or bore \nperformance details can assist in raising the profile of shortages and demand needs.  Recent experience \nhas shown that in combination, all of the above communication tools have been effective in heightened public awareness and consciousness of water efficiency measures, particularly over summer months.  \nAs well as engaging the community in voluntary demand reduction measures Wannon Water can liaise with major consumption customers to work out strategies to reduce consumption.  Major customers include the local shire, community groups, industrial and rural water users.  \nMandatory Water Restrictions \nThe main purpose of water restrictions is to conserve dwindling supplies during drought periods.   \nDrought response triggers have been revised following augmentation of the system in 2010 with the \ncompletion of the pipeline from Rocklands Reservoir. The revised drought response triggers are related \nto the total volume of water available in the local Hamilton storages and water held by Wannon Water in the Available Bank Ac count from the Wimmera/Glenelg system.   \nThe anticipated water savings for each level of restriction is shown in Table C7 . These savings have \nbeen tested by comparing residential KL per connection over the period 2005/2006 to 2010/2011 for \nHamilton against  other towns not subject to water restrictions.

However, this means that if the storages spill, then all water held in the spillable water account is lost.  \nFor Wannon Water, carryover provides an effective method to mitigate the impacts of low allocation \nyears which may occur in the Glenelg/Wimmera system. That is, when base allocations are low, Wannon \nWater may be able to call on water which has been carried over, to maintain minimum supply requirements.  \n  \n \n47 \n C1.4  Drought Response Actions  \nSystem monitoring is undertaken to assess the status of the supply system according to one of the \nfollowing three operational modes:  \nMode 1 \u2013 General Monitoring  \n \nMode 2 \u2013 Heightened Awareness   \nMode 3 \u2013 Drought Response   \nC1.4.1  Mode 1 \u2013 General Monitoring (Pre -Drought Phase Activities)  \nThe zone for the General Monitoring mode is defined by the system storage capacity as the upper bound \nand a trigger which is set just above the system operating curve, as the lower bound.  \nThere are a number of important factors in pre drought monitoring and planning which will influence the decision to declare the system as being in the General Monitoring mode. These include:  \n\u2022 Storage contents, stream flows and bore performance data to monitor availability of supply ;  \n\u2022 Climatic trends and seasonal outlooks as indicators of the possible onset of drought;  \n\u2022 Consumption trends to indicate changes in Customer\u2019s usage of water; and  \n\u2022 Forecasting storage behaviour over a 6- 12 month period.  \n \nThe Annual Water Outlook  tool is used to monitor supply and demand side aspects of the system. \nDuring the General Monitoring mode, the system status is updated on a weekly basis and a report \nprepar ed weekly. A summary of the key system performance indicators for the Grampians Supply \nSystem which should be included in the Annual Water Outlook  and System Status Report is provided in \nTable C9.   \n  \n\n \n48 \n Table C 8 Requirements fo r Annual Water Outlook  and System Status Monitoring and \nReporting  \nItem Requirements  \nRainfall, seasonal climate outlook  Information accessed from Bureau of Meteorology \nwebsite.  \nState -wide status  Bureau of Meteorology and Department of Environment, \nLand, Water and Planning websites provide status \nreports on rainfall, streamflow, storage levels, groundwater and urban water restrictions across Victoria on a monthly basis.  \nSystem storage contents  Monitored at least weekly and recorded in an operational database.  Data recorded for all towns.  \n \nInflows from Headworks streams  Monitored at least weekly and recorded in an operational database.  Data recorded for all towns.  \nAllocation Forecasts  Seeking updates on allocations within the Wimmera/ Glenelg system and information on likely \nincreases during low allocation periods.  \nWater levels in ground water supply systems are monitored at least monthly and are able to be compared against pump depths.  The frequency of monitoring should be increased t o \nweekly or daily if a decline in water level raises concern on the security of the system.  \nSystem Demands (bulk meter consumption)  Monitored at least weekly and recorded in an operational database.  Data recorded for all towns.  \n \n \nThe trigger mechanism for actions is the total system resource volume, using the Drought Response \nTriggers shown in Appendix C2.  \nForward look projections of storage response forms an integral part of the short term planning during a \ndrought. Projections assist to anticipate the \u201clikely\u201d response based on current climatic conditions. At a \nminimum, Wannon Water makes projections over the next 3- 12 months based on its experience in \nprevious droughts. However, seasonal forecasting over three month, six month and 12 month periods, \nincorporating information from low -frequency climate signals such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation \nIndex and sea surface temperatures, may also be useful in this assessment. System modelling tools \nsuch as Ewater Source can also be utilised when undertaking forward look projections, as they can \naccount for antecedent conditions such as soil moisture levels, and can translate rainfall and demand \nprojections into changes in storage levels.  \n \n  \n \n49 \n 4.2 Mode 2 \u2013 Heightened Awareness  \nThe zone for the Heightened Awareness mode is designed to provide early warning of a pending water \nshortage. The Heightened Awareness mode is triggered following consideration of:  \n\u2022 Storage contents, stream flows and bore performance data to monitor availability of supply;  \n\u2022 Climatic trends and seasonal outlooks;  \n\u2022 Consumption trends to indicate changes in Customer\u2019s usage of water; and  \n\u2022 Forecasting storage behaviour over a 3- 6 month period.  \nThe key actions are summarised in Table C10 (in order of increasing impact from water shortages).  \n \n \n50 \n Table C 9 Grampians System Action Plan for Mode 2 \u2013 Heightened Awareness  \nAction  Trigger  Response  \nAction 1  High likelihood that total storage \ncontents cannot be maintained above the System Operating \nCurves  1. \nReconvene the Drought Response Monitoring Committee  \nAction 2 Moderate to high likelihood that total storage contents cannot be maintained above the Level 1 \nDrought Response Trigger  2. \nProvide weekly updates of the System Status Report  \n3.

Glenthompson Water Supply System  \nD1.1  Details of the Glenthompson Water Supply System \nD1.1.1 System Description  \nThe Glenthompson Reservoir  has a capacity  of 110 ML, is located close to the township and has a small \nsurface catchment.  Infrastructure to harvest water from a nearby catchment  (Railway Reservoir) was \ndecommissioned in 2015 following cost -benefit analysis that identified its use did not substantially \nimprove system security but required significant works.  The Willaura pipeline is used to supply rural \ncustomers and supply  the reservoir when it becomes low and draws water from Grampians Wimmera \nMallee Water\u2019s Willaura system.  The source for this  is surface run- off from offtakes on Mount William \nCreek and Masons Creek in the Grampians National Park, supplemented by supply from a borefield on Mount William Creek.  The borefield capacity was increased significantly to 1 ML/d in the Millennium \ndrought.  \n \nAn important feature of the system is that approximately half of the demand on the system is from the \nrural users along the Willaura pipeline, before the pipeline reaches the Glenthompson reservoir.  These customers have similar access to water as Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water\u2019s (GWMW) rural \ncustomers on the upstream pipeline.  However, due to the relatively high elevation of the Glenthompson \nstorage and the associated hydraulics, Glenthompson storage is only supplied for limited periods requiring GWMW  to isolate part of its system.  Wannon Water liaises with GWMW in respect of the \ntiming of delivery from the Willaura pipeline to Glenthompson Reservoir.  The security of the town supply is heavily reliant on this delivery because the local catchment for Glenthompson reservoir does not produce runoff in dry years.  \n The Willaura System is managed by GWMW.  The Glenthompson township and our pipeline customers only constitute a small proportion (15%) of the overall demand on the Willaura System.   \n \nA schematic of the proportion of the supply system managed by Wannon Water is shown in Figure D1.  Connections for the rural properties are provided along the 24 km pipeline.   \n \n  \n \n57 \n Figure D1 Glenthompson Water Supply System  \n \nWater is treated and stored in a 0.15ML tank on elevated land adjacent to the reservoirs.  Water is \nsupplied to the town by gravity from this tank.  \n \nD1.1.2 System Demands and Consumption \nThe total demand represents the unrestricted water usage from the headworks, inclusive of system \ndistribution losses. The current ( 2021) a verage annual demand for the system is adopted for long term \nplanning purposes, including the development of Wannon Water\u2019s water restriction policies.  \nThe estimated total a verage annual d emand for the Glenth ompson Water Supply System is 48 ML/year . \nThe components of this demand are presented in Table D1.  \n  \n\n \n58 \n Table D 1 Components of the 20 20/21 Average Annual Demand Estimate  \nComponent  Total \nDemand \n(ML) Base \nDemand \n(ML) Restrictable \nDemand \n(ML) \nResidential  8 6.4 1.6 \nNon Residential 1 0.8 0.2 \nRural  25 25 - \nMajor  0 0 - \nPublic Open Space  0 0 - \nTotal Consumption  34 31.2 1.8 \nNonrevenue Water  2 2 - \nBulk Usage (WTP Outflow+Pipeline \ncustomers)  36 34.2 1.8 \nWTP Losses  1 1 - \nSystem losses (upstream of WTPs)  1 1 - \nTotal Raw Water Usage  38 36.2 1.8 \n \nD1.1.3 System Yield and Security of Supply  \nFor the Glenthompson Water Supply System, the average annual demand that can be supplied at the \nadopted 95% annual reliability is close to current demand.  Booster pumping of the pipeline from Willaura \nwas implemented in 2020- 21 utilising a portable pumping skid. The skid is stored at the Hamilton Depot \nfor future use. The increased flow achieved using the booster  is expected to secure this supply in the \nmedium term.  \n  \n \n59 \n D1.2  Drought Experience  \nDuring the 1982/ 1983 drought the Glenthompson Reservoir was full  (110 ML) at the beginning of \nSeptember, 1981, and did not receive any runoff for the period through to mid April, 1983, a period of 21 \nmonths. The storage was rapidly depleted and by 1 April, 1982, held only 17 ML. From that time until the \ndrought ended the Glenthompson system was almost totally reliant on the Willaura pipe line. An \nestimated 3 ML was held in the storage just prior to the drought breaking.  \nSince 1995, restrictions have been implemented frequently as the reliability of inflows to the local s torage \nhas been low. Water restrictions were required continuously over the period 1995 to 2009, including a 12 month period of Stage 4 restrictions from October 2006. Whilst water restrictions only impacted the residential customers, demand from the rural  customers taking raw water from the system was also \nlower as de- stocking occurred from 2007/2008 onwards.  \nFollowing customer concerns about the severity of the supply situation, exemptions were made under the Stage 4 restrictions allowing bucket watering of gardens. Restrictions were lifted in October 2009.  \n \nA summary of the restrictions since 1995 is provided in Table D3 . \n  \n \n60 \n Table D2 Glenthompson System Recent History of Restrictions  \nDate  Stage  Action  \n18/02/1995  2 Introduced  \n17/06/1995  2 Lifted  \n17/01/1998  1 Introduced  \n11/07/1998  1 Lifted  \n12/09/1998  1 Introduced  \n12/12/1998  2 Introduced  \n21/09/2000  1 Reduced from Stage 2  \n14/10/2000  1 Lifted  \n12/11/2005  1 Introduced  \n01/04/2006  2 Introduced  \n14/10/2006  4 Introduced  \n3/11/2007  2 Reduced from Stage 4  \n4/10/2009  PWSR  Stage 2 Lifted \u2013 returned to \nPWSR  \nD1.3  Drought Response Options  \nD1.3.1 Introduction \nThere are two methods which can be applied in the event of a drought or water shortage, these being \ndemand reduction and supply augmentation.  \nOn the basis of the performance of existing systems during past droughts it is considered that demand management should form the first stage in this drought response program. Supply augmentation would be considered if this stage failed to achieve the response or if the severity of the drought necessitates it.  \nA condition of the Glenthompson bulk entitlement (subject to current application) will be the requirement to restrict urban demands in the system when GWMWater  imposes water restrictions in their supply \nsystems which source water from the Willaura system or reduce the maximum daily rate of taking water from the Willaura headworks to a rate agreed to by GWMWater.  \nOptions for both these measures are detailed below.  \n \n61 \n D1.3.2 Demand Reduction During Droughts  \nThere are a number of demand reduction options that can be employed during times of water shortage.  \nA summary of demand reduction options is shown in Table D4.  \nTable D 3 S ummary of Demand Reduction Options  \nOption  Details  Comments  \nCommunity Education \nPrograms  Water efficiency awareness (showerhead rebates, information brochures), linked to ongoing State Government programs.  \nEstimated savings are of  \n2-5% of total demand over next 2 \nyears.  Being progressively implemented by Wannon Water.   \nVoluntary Demand Reduction Measures  Self regulated water conservation measures aimed at increasing effectiveness of measures within the Permanent Water Saving Plan, \nand potential savings if water restrictions are implemented.  Water savings from this option are expected to exceed the savings already achieved from the Permanent Water Saving Plan.  \nMandatory Water Restrictions  Option available under  \nBy-Law No. 6. See Appendix B for requirements and prohibitions on water usage.  \nCompliance Officer/s  Additional resources may be required during extended periods \nof moderate to severe restrictions \nto monitor the performance of targeted water savings measures.   \nRestrict Supply to Rural Customers  Possible under agreement only.  A restriction policy for rural customers requires further development.  \n \nMonitoring of the Glenthompson system is important due to reliance on surface supplies and limited \naccess to supplementary sources. Accordingly, demand reduction forms the basis of the Drought \nResponse Plan for Glenthompson and needs to be implemented early to be effective.  \nAs with the Grampians System,  it is proposed that the first phase of demand reduction should involve a \nrequest to the consumers for voluntary reduction in water usage.  \nHalf of Glenthompson\u2019s demand is from supply -by-agreement rural users on the pipeline from Willaura. If \nsupply from the Willaura system failed, supply to these users would not be guaranteed. For the \nGlenthompson township, voluntary and mandatory restrictions combined with community education programs would be the main tools used to manage demand.   \n  \n \n62 \n The anticipated water savings for each level of restriction is shown in Table D5 . These savings have \nbeen tested by comparing residential KL per connection over the period 2005/2006 to 2010/2011 for \nHamilton against other towns not subject to water restrictions.   The residential consumption rates shown \nin Table D5 provide guidance on the level of consumption which should be targeted to achieve the stated \nwater savings.  \nTable D5  An ticipated Water Savings from Water Restrictions  for Glenthompson \nRestriction \nLevel  Estimated Water Saving  Target \nResidential \nConsumption \nRate  \n% of Restrictable \nDemand1 Volume  \n(ML) % of Total Raw \nWater Use2 KL/ \nconnection/  \nyr L/ \nperson/ \nday \nPWSM     167 200 \nStage 1  13% - 16% 0.3 1% 156 185 \nStage 2  40% - 50% 1 3% 146 173 \nStage 3  60% - 75% 1.5 4% 140 166 \nStage 4  95% -100%  2 6% 130 154 \n1.

These include:  \n\u2022 Storage contents, stream flows and bore performance data to monitor availability of supply;  \n\u2022 Climatic trends and seasonal outlooks as indicators of the possible onset of drought;  \n\u2022 Consumption trends to indicate changes in Customer\u2019s usage of water;  \n\u2022 Forecasti ng storage behaviour over a 6- 12 month period;  \n\u2022 Regular consultation with GWMWater regarding the supply status for the Willaura System.  \nThe Annual Water Outlook  tool is used to monitor supply and demand side aspects of the system. \nDuring the General Monitoring mode, the system status is updated on a weekly basis and a report prepared weekly. A summary of the key system performance indicators for the Glenthompson Supply System which should be included in the Annual Water Outlook  and System Status Report is  provided in \nTable D7.   \n \n  \n \n \n\n \n64 \n Table D 7 Requirements for Annual Water Outlook  and System Status Monitoring and \nReporting  \nItem Requirements  \nRainfall, seasonal climate outlook  Information accessed from Bureau of Meteorology \nwebsite.  \nState -wide status  Bureau of Meteorology and Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning websites provide status \nreports on rainfall, streamflow, storage levels, groundwater and urban water restrictions across Victoria on a monthly basis.  \nSystem storage contents  Monitored at least weekly and recorded in an operational database.

Groundwater Supply Systems  \nE1.1 Details of Groundwater Supply Systems  \nE1.1.1  System Descriptions  \nWannon Water manages 10 water supply systems that use groundwater as the primary source of water.  \nWhilst most of these systems typically supply one township, two  have been set up to supply multiple \ntownships via a piped distribution network.  There are also distinct hydrogeologic regions which water is \nextracted from to supply these towns, these being from either shallower groundwat er sources or from a \ndeeper groundwater resource referred to as the Dilwyn  Aquifer .  The towns supplied from groundwater  \nresources are shown in Tables E1 and E2.  \nTable E1 Sh allow Groundwater Supply Systems  \nSystem  Towns  Supplied and \nOther Users  Sources of Supply  Entitlements \n(ML) \nTullich  Casterton, Sandford, Merino, Coleraine  4 bores west of Casterton  1000  \n  Konongwootong Reservoir1  \nPenshurst  Penshurst  2 bores  250 \nCaramut  Caramut  2 bores  50 \nDarlington  Darlington  1 bores  10 \nNote 1 Kept as an emergency backup supply for the Tullich System  \n \nTable E2 Deep Groundwater Supply Systems  \nSystem  Towns  Supplied and \nOther Users  Sources of Supply  Entitlements (ML) \nDartmoor  Dartmoor  1 bore  170 \nHeywood  Heywood  2 bores  333 \nPortland Portland 3 bores  6222  \nPort Fairy  Port Fairy  2 bores  1026  \nPort Campbell  Port Campbell, \nPeterborough, Timboon  1 bore1 1009  \nMacarthur  Macarthur  1 bore  130 \nNote 1 Second bore to be constructed in 2022  \n \nFurther details for each of the supply systems are provided in the following sections.   \n \n72 \n E1.1.2 Shallow Groundwater Systems  \nTullich Groundwater System  \nThe Tullich Borefield consists of four production bores all of which are equipped. There are also two \nobservation bores.  Two production bores were constructed in 1989 and the other two in 2004. The observation bores were constructed in 2004.  \nWater from the Tullich Borefield is pumped to the treatment plant which is located on the western side of Casterton. The treated water is then fed into the Casterton, Coleraine, Sandford and Merino systems.  \nMerino was previously supplied with  groundwater from the Mocamboro b orefield but has been supplied \nfrom Casterton since December 2005. Water is pumped via a 14 km, 100  mm diameter rising main from \nCasterton via Sandford to the Merino service basin.  \nColeraine has been supplied from the Tull ich system since 2009. \nFigure E1 Tullich Groundwater System  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n73 \n Penshurst Groundwater System  \nThis water supply system consists of a main production bore located on the flanks of Mount Rouse \nadjacent to two service basins to the south of the township. The service basins have a combined \ncapacity of 2 ML and act as a balancing storage.  \nA second emergency bore is located adjacent to the Hawkesdale Road to the south of the township and can be connected into the feeder main that supplies the town from the main Mount Rouse production \nbore.  \nFigure E2 Penshurst Groundwater System  \n \nCaramut Groundwater System  \nThe original supply to this small rural community was sourced from spring water which was col lected in a \nsmall concrete basin and then pumped 11 km to a 45 kL elevated tank.  Overflow from the elevated tank \nwas then piped into an adjacent 15.5 ML service basin.  Water then gravitated through a further 8.5 km \nof pipeline to a 45 kL elevated tank supplying the township.   \nIn 1999 a 0.6 ML concrete tank was constructed adjacent to the service basin and the basin was taken \nout of service.  The spring is no longer in use and two production bores have been installed at the spring site.  \nThe transfer pump from the bores to the Caramut Tank has a design capacity of 30 000 L/hour.  \nFigure E3 Caramut Groundwater System  \n \n\n \n74 \n Darlington Groundwater System  \nTwo bores at Darlington provide a non potable water supply to 21 customers.  The bores are both \nshallow (less than 40 m deep) and located adjacent to the Darlington CFA station.  Construction of both \nbores is poorly understood.  The newer of the two bores (58343) is used preferentially, and the second bore is retained as an emergency backup but not equipped.   \nFigure E4 Darlington Groundwater System  \n \n \nE1.1.3 Deep Groundwater Systems   \nPortland, Heywood, Port Fairy & Dartmoor Groundwater Systems  \nDeep bores extracting water from the Dilwyn Aquifer  provide 100% of water supply for the towns of \nPortland, Heywood, Dartmoor and Port Fairy.

The bore is 520 metres deep, has a small artesian flow and can be pumped at rates up to 40 \nlitres/sec. Following the completion of a new supply system, Peterborough was connected to the Port \nCampbell bore in December 1998.  The 12 Apostles  visitor centre was connected in 2021 via a 10.5 km \npipeline from the Port Campbell tank.  A second bore is to be constructed in 2022.  \nStorage within this supply system includes a service basin, three ground level tanks, an elevated tank \nand several water towers  \nDemand for water varies seasonally due to the high tourist population during summer.  Some 40 rural users also draw water direct from the rising main supplying Peterborough and Timboon.  \nFigure E9 Port Campbell Groundwate r System  \n \n \n  \n\n \n77 \n Macarthur Groundwater System  \nThe Macarthur water supply system was commissioned in 1994 and is supplied with groundwater from \none production bore, referred to as Macarthur No.1, which is located approximately 1 km to the north of \nthe townshi p.   \nWater from the bore is pumped to a treatment plant and then stored in a 500 kL clear water storage tank \nprior to being gravity fed to the township.  \nFigure E10 Macarthur Groundwater System  \n \nE1.1.4  System Demand  \nTable E4 shows demand in 2020/2021 for each of the Groundwater  systems.  \nComponents of the Current (20 21) Annual Demand - Portland  \nComponent  Total Demand (ML) \nResidential  704 \nNon Residential  222 \nRural  1 \nMajor  326 \nPublic Open Space  23 \nTotal Consumption  1276  \nNonrevenue Water  225 \nBulk Usage (WTP Outflow)  1501  \nWTP Losses  157 \nTotal Raw Water Usage  1658  \nComponents of the Current (20 21) Annual Demand - Port Fairy  \n\n \n78 \n Component  Total Demand \n(ML) \nResidential  276 \nNon Residential  107 \nRural  0 \nMajor  143 \nPublic Open Space  5 \nTotal Consumption  532 \nNonrevenue Water  70 \nBulk Usage (WTP Outflow)  602 \nWTP Losses  48 \nTotal Raw Water Usage  650 \n  \nComponents of the Current (20 21) Annual Demand - Tullich \nSystem  \nComponent  Total Demand (ML) \nResidential  176 \nNon Residential  67 \nRural  81 \nMajor  0 \nPublic Open Space  6 \nTotal Consumption  331 \nNonrevenue Water  50 \nBulk Usage (WTP Outflow)  381 \nWTP Losses  13 \nTotal Raw Water Usage  394 \nComponents of the Current (20 21) Annual Demand - Pt Campbell \nSystem  \n \n79 \n Component  Total Demand \n(ML) \nResidential  105 \nNon Residential  57 \nRural  71 \nMajor  0 \nPublic Open Space  4 \nTotal Consumption  237 \nNonrevenue Water  45 \nBulk Usage (WTP Outflow)  281 \nWTP Losses  44 \nTotal Raw Water Usage  325 \n  \nComponents of the Current (20 21) Annual Demand - Heywood  \nComponent  Total Demand (ML) \nResidential  89 \nNon Residential  24 \nRural  0 \nMajor  0 \nPublic Open Space  1 \nTotal Consumption  113 \nNonrevenue Water  20 \nBulk Usage (WTP Outflow)  133 \nWTP Losses  11 \nTotal Raw Water Usage  144 \nComponents of the Current (20 21) Annual Demand - Dartmoor  \n \n80 \n Component  Total Demand \n(ML) \nResidential  15 \nNon Residential  2 \nRural  0 \nMajor  0 \nPublic Open Space  0 \nTotal Consumption  17 \nNonrevenue Water  6 \nBulk Usage (WTP Outflow)  23 \nWTP Losses  0.5 \nTotal Raw Water Usage  23.5 \n  \nComponents of the Current (20 21) Annual Demand - Penshurst  \nComponent  Total Demand (ML) \nResidential  37 \nNon Residential  12 \nRural  0 \nMajor  0 \nPublic Open Space  2 \nTotal Consumption  52 \nNonrevenue Water  15 \nBulk Usage (WTP Outflow)  67 \nWTP Losses  1 \nTotal Raw Water Usage  68 \n  \nComponents of the Current (20 21) Annual Demand - Caramut  \n \n81 \n Component  Total Demand \n(ML) \nResidential  7 \nNon Residential  3 \nRural  2 \nMajor  0 \nPublic Open Space  3 \nTotal Consumption  16 \nNonrevenue Water  5 \nBulk Usage (WTP Outflow)  21 \nWTP Losses  7 \nTotal Raw Water Usage  28 \n  \nComponents of the Current (20 21) Annual Demand - Darlington  \nComponent  Total Demand (ML) \nResidential  3 \nNon Residential  0 \nRural  0 \nMajor  0 \nPublic Open Space  0 \nTotal Consumption  3 \nNonrevenue Water  0.7 \nBulk Usage (WTP Outflow)  3.7 \nWTP Losses  0.2 \nTotal Raw Water Usage  3.9 \n  \nComponents of the Current (20 21) Annual Demand - Macarthur  \n \n82 \n Component  Total Demand \n(ML) \nResidential  14 \nNon Residential  2 \nRural  1 \nMajor  0 \nPublic Open Space  1 \nTotal Consumption  18 \nNonrevenue Water  7 \nBulk Usage (WTP Outflow)  25 \nWTP Losses  3 \nTotal Raw Water Usage  28 \n  \n \n83 \n E1.1.5 System Yields and Security of Supply  \nFor the systems supplied from groundwater, the yield of the system is assumed to be equivalent to the \ncurrent licensed volume (or entitlement). This yield estimate is currently not linked to reliability measures \nsuch as the frequency of restrictions. The adopted yield for each groundwater supplied system is \nsummarised in Table E5 .  \nTable E4 Es timated System Yield for Groundwater Systems  \n Yield  (ML/a)  \nShallow Groundwater System   \nTullich  1,000  \nPenshurst  100 \nCaramut  50 \nDarlington  10 \nDeep Groundwater Systems   \nWest Dilwyn   \nDartmoor  170 \nHeywood  333 \nPortland  6,222 \nPort Fairy  1,026 \nEast Dilwyn   \nPort Campbell  1,009  \nOther   \nMacarthur  130 \n \nThe yield in all groundwater systems exceeds estimated demand.  \nAnalysis has shown that all groundwater systems are currently reliable at the current level of \ndevelopment and are quite resilient to the impacts from climate change. The shallow groundwater \nsystems have also been shown to be highly reliable at the full licence volume level of development. \nThere is uncertainty about the reliability of the deeper groundwater systems at levels of demand which are higher than present.  \n \n \n84 \n E1.2 Drought Experience  \nRecords indicate that all towns supplied by groundwater have not had water supply concerns as a result \nof drought, except for Caramut and Merino.  Since 2006, water restrictions have not been required for any of Wannon Water\u2019s towns that are supplied with groundwater.  Coleraine had Stage 1 restrictions in \nforce from December 2006 to June 2007 while still supplied from the Konongwootong Reservoir water \nsupply system . \nCaramut  \nThe Caramut water supply system was constructed in 1977.  The spring supply proved to be totally \ninadequate during a drought.  Severe water restrictions were imposed during 1982 and maintained until \nthe drought broke in April 1983.  \nA bore was constructed adjacent to the spring in 1983 and a second bore was drilled in 1999.  Whilst the \nspring ceased to flow over the summer of 2000 the bores maintained supply within acceptable drawdown \nlimits. No water restrictions at Caramut have been required since 1983.  \nMerino  \nThe Merino system was constructed during 1976 and so did not experience the 1967/ 1968 drought.  \nDuring the 1982/ 1983 drought restrictions were applied during January 1983 and remained in force until \nthe end of the drought.  With these in place the Merino system adequately catered for demand and had \nreasonable reserves at the end of the drought.  It is noted that there was considerable demand for water \nfrom the Merino standpipe by people from outside the waterworks district.  \nIn 2005 Merino was connected to the Casterton system and the Merino bores (Mocamboro borefield) were taken off -line. The bores were decommissioned in 2018 and the bore licence surrended. \nCasterton, Coleraine and Sandford  \nThe Konongwootong Reservoir did not receive any run -off during the winter of 1967 and accordingly the \nstorage level was low.  Restrictions were applied in September of 1967 for both Casterton and Coler aine \nand all of the rural consumers along the supply lines.  The restrictions were up- graded in October 1967 \nto severe levels which banned the use of hoses.  At the same time a series of investigations were commenced on alternative sources of supply.  \nIn January of 1968 preliminary arrangements were made to facilitate pumping of water from the Konongwootong Reservoir from below the outlet level and these were subsequently implemented.  \nRestrictions were lifted in May of 1968 at the end of the drought.  \nThe Tullich Borefield was identified as a supplementary water source for Casterton and brought on line in 1969 after the drought ended.   \nDuring the 1982/ 1983 drought the Tullich Borefield was used to provide as much water as possible for \nthe Casterton Supply. As water levels at Konongwootong were somewhat higher at the end of the 1982 winter than they had been in 1967 and with the dual benefit of the Tullich supply and restrictions, the system catered for demands with the Konongwootong Reservoir dropping to a low of 3.4 m just prior to \nthe end of the drought.  \nRestrictions were applied in early January of 1983 and remained in place until the end of the drought.  \n \n85 \n Some problems have been experienced at Tullich due to pumpset failures and diminished output from \nthe bores. The bore problems were associated with clogging of the screens and not reduced output from the aquifer. This resulted in the construction of two new bores with improved construction materials in 1989.  \nFor Casterton, Sandford and Coleraine Stage 1 restrictions were imposed in February 2000 and lifted in October 2000.  Also Stage 1 restrictions were imposed in January 2001 and lifted in September 2001.  \nColeraine, Sandford and two- thirds of Casterton were supplied from Konongwootong until March 2004 \nrequi ring the restrictions in 2000 and 2001.  \nA third and forth production bore w ere constructed in 2005, however only one of the new bores (Bore \nNo.4) was equipped.  In 2010, the remaining bore (Bore No.3) was equipped.  . The expanded Tullich borefield has successfully supplied Casterton, Sandford and Merino since 2005.  Stage 1 restrictions \nwere introduced on 16 December 2006 and remained for approximately 6 months until they were \nremoved on 9 July 2007.  \nA pipeline was constructed from Casterton to Coleraine with Coleraine being supplied from the Tullich system from 2009. \nThe Konongwootong Reservoir is maintained as the supply for rural customers and as an emergency \nsupply for the Tullich system.  \nE1.3 Drought Response Options  \nE1.3.1 Introduction \nFor the shallower groundwater systems, reducing the extraction rate (through the implementation of \nrestrictions) may have an impact on the rate of drawdown of the resource, however in most \ncircumstances, the pressures placed on the resource by other groundwater users a nd a lack of recharge \n(considered in a more regional context), may be having a greater influence on drawdown.   \nPreceding climatic conditions will be the major factor associated with the decline in the resource, and \ntherefore alternative supply arrangements should be considered as the primary method for responding to short term water shortages.  \nFor deeper groundwater systems, resource drawdown is influenced by events which have significant \nlead times, and response to drought conditions is often suppressed by these lag times .  Therefore, \nreducing demand in unlikely to be an effective method of mitigating supply shortfalls.  Furthermore, bores \ntapping the deeper groundwater systems, e.g., Lower Tertiary Aquifer, have a greater capacity to accommodate deepening of pumps to ensure continued extraction.  \nFurther details on demand and supply side options during drought are provided in the following tables.  \n \n \n  \n \n86 \n E1.3.2 Demand Reduction During Droughts  \nThere are a number of demand reduction options that can be employed during times of water shortage.  \nA summary of demand reduction options is shown in Table E6.  \nTable E 5 S ummary of Demand Reduction Options  \nOption  Details  Comments  \nCommunity Education \nPrograms  Water efficiency awareness (showerhead rebates, information brochures), linked to ongoing State Government programs.  \nEstimated savings are of  \n2-5% of total demand over next 2 \nyears.  Being progressively implemented by Wannon Water.   \nVoluntary Demand Reduction Measures  Self regulated water conservation measures aimed at increasing effectiveness of measures within the Permanent Water Saving Plan, \nand potential savings if water restrictions are implemented.  Water savings from this option are expected to exceed the savings already achieved from the Permanent Water Saving Plan.  \nMandatory Water Restrictions  Option available under  \nBy-Law No. 6. See Appendix B for requirements and prohibitions on water usage.  \nCompliance Officer/s  Additional resources may be required during extended periods of moderate to severe restrictions \nto monitor the performance of \ntargeted water savings measures.   \nRestrict Supply to Rural Customers  Possible under agreement only.  A restriction policy for rural customers requires further development.  \n \nE1.3.3 Supply Augmentation Options During Drought  \nA summary of the range of short -term supply augmentation options for (shallow) groundwater systems is \nshown in Table E7 . \nTable E 6 S upply Augmentation Options During Drought  \nOption  Details  Available Supply  \nWater Cartage  Cartage from adjacent system \nwhere surplus exists.  Available as either raw water or potable water. Supplied under Stage 4 restrictions to reduce supply volume.  \nConstruct Emergency bores  Reduce demand pressure on existing bores  Lead times may be significant.  \n \n \n87 \n E1.4 Drought Response Actions  \nSystem monitoring is undertaken to assess the status of the supply system according to one of the \nfollowing three operational modes:  \nMode 1 \u2013 General Monitoring  \n \nMode 2 \u2013 Heightened Awareness   \nMode 3 \u2013 Drought Response   \nE1.4.1  Mode 1 \u2013 General Monitoring (Pre -Drought Phase Activities)  \nThe zone for the General Monitoring mode is defined by the groundwater level as the upper bound and a trigger which is set above pump level, as the lower bound.  \nThere are a number of important factors in pre drought monitoring and planning which will influence the decision to declare the system as being in the General Monitoring mode. These include:  \n\u2022 Short and longer term trends in the groundwater level;  \n\u2022 Climatic trends and seasonal outlooks as indicators of the possible onset of drought;  \n\u2022 Consumption trends to indicate changes in customer\u2019s usage of water; and  \n\u2022 Forecasting groundwater levels over a 6- 12 month period.  \nThe Annual Water Outlook  tool is used to monitor supply and demand side aspects of the system. \nDuring the General Monitoring mode, the system status is updated on a weekly basis and a report \nprepared weekly. A summary of the key system performance indicators for all groundwater systems \nwhich should be included in the Annual Water Outlook  and System Status Report is provided in \nTable  E8.   \n\n \n88 \n Table E 7 Requirements for Annual Water Outlook  and System Status Monitoring and \nReporting  \nItem Requirements  \nRainfall, seasonal climate outlook  Information accessed from Bureau of Meteorology \nwebsite.  \nState -wide status  Bureau of Meteorology and Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning websites provide status \nreports on rainfall, streamflow, storage levels, groundwater and urban water restrictions across Victoria on a monthly basis.  \nReview of observation bore data (remote from borefield) for seasonal trends.  \nReview of Groundwater Management Area  monitoring \ndocuments prepared by Southern Rural Water to assess \nmonitoring trends and use trends.  \nWater levels in ground water supply systems are monitored at least mo nthly \nand are able to be compared against pump depths\n1. The frequency of monitoring should be increased to weekly or daily if a decline in water level raises concern on the security of the system.  \nSystem Demands (bulk meter consumption)  Monitored at least weekly and recorded in an operational database.  Data recorded for all towns . \n \nNote: 1. Enables determination of available drawdown, i.e. the amount of water above the pump intake  \nE1.4.2  Mode 2 \u2013 Heightened Awareness  \nThe zone for the Heightened Awareness mode is designed to provide early warning of a pending water \nshortage. The Heightened Awareness mode is triggered following consideration of:  \n\u2022 Short term trend in the groundwater level;  \n\u2022 Climatic trends and seasonal outlooks;  \n\u2022 Consumption trends to indicate changes in Customer\u2019s usage of water; and  \n\u2022 Forecasting groundwater levels over a 3- 6 month period.  \nThe key actions are summarised in Table E 9  (in order of increasing impact from water shortages).  \n \n \n89 \n Table E 8 Groundwater Systems Action Plan for Mode 2 \u2013 Heightened Awareness  \nAction  Trigger  Response  \nAction 1 Moderate likelihood that \ngroundwater levels will fall below the Mode 3 Trigger  1. Provide weekly updates of the System Status Report  \n2. Implement demand reduction options such as Community Education Programs, Voluntary Demand Reduction Measures via increased media advertising,  \nAction 2 High likelihood that groundwater levels will fall below the Mode 3 Trigger  3. Alert public to the imminent water shortages and possible need for restrictions in the future.  \n4. Promote \u201cvoluntary restrictions\u201d via media advertising campaigns to inform consumers about water conservation programs.  \n5. Develop contingency plans for alternative supplies if water levels were to fall below pump \nlevels.  \n6. Declare operational mode as Mode 3 - Drought Response.  \n \n \n \n90 \n E1.4.3 Mode 3 - Drought Response  \nMode 3 defines an active drought response period where supply and/or demand side measures are \nrequired to maintain supply security. Water r estriction s may be used to reduce demand to reduce the \nrequirements from alternative supplies. Management actions for consideration during Mode 3 are \nsummarised in Table E10. \n \nTable E9 Gr oundwater Systems Action Plan for Mode 3 \u2013 Drought Response  \nAction  Trigger  Response  \nAction 3 Moderate likelihood that \ngroundwater levels will \nfall below the pump level \n 7. Consider implementation of mild restrictions such as Stage 2, as \npreparedness for making alternative supply arrangements;  \n8. Progress contingency plans for alternative supplies to an \nimplementation ready status, including obtaining any necessary \npermits or approvals.  \n9. Monitor bore condition and water quality . \n10. Review and maximise pump depth setting\u2019 or if such capacity \nexists, install additional pump rising main and switch to hi-lift pu mp \nAction 4 High likelihood that \ngroundwater levels will \nfall below the pump level \n 11. Monitor groundwater levels and perform regular forward look \nstorage projections.  \n12. Consider implementation Stage 3 restrictions, as preparedness for \nmaking alternative supply arrangements;  \n13. Communicate to customers the potential future impacts to supply \ntheir arrangements;  \n14. Implement contingency plans for alternative supplies.  \nAction 5 Groundwater levels fall \nbelow the pump level  15. Implementation Stage 4 water restrictions.  \n16. Communicate to customers the altered supply arrangements;  \n17. Commence alternative supplies.  \n18. Commence tankering water where required  \n \nNote that when there is a likelihood of water levels approaching pump intakes, there is an increased \nlikelihood of damage to the pumps and possibly the bore i.e. increased maintenance, and water quality \nissues   \nIt is therefore appropriate to continually review and maximise pump depth setting\u2019 or if such capacity \nexists, install additional pump rising main and switch to hi -lift pump.  Permanently setting pumps at too \ngreat a depth results in higher operational costs outside of the drought periods.  \n \n \n \n91 \n E1.4.4 Drought Response  Triggers  \nShallow Groundwater Systems  \nThe shallow groundwater systems developed by Wannon Water are mostly unconfined to semi -confined \naquifers which are directly recharged by infiltrating rainfall.  Therefore aquifer storage, groundwater use \nand water levels are affected by changes and in climate and dry conditions.  \nWater level s in the production bores  can be used as a trigger to indicate the appropriate drought \nmanagement regime.  The current pump depth settings are indicated in Table E11 .  All elevations are \napproximate and in some cases pump depth setting was estimated  and requires confirmation. \nA wa ter level at the pump intake will result in inability to extract water from the bore, additional drought \nresponse action must be taken if this occurs.  \nA level of 3 m above the pump will risk ability to extract water.   A water level within 3 m of the pump, or \nthe lowest pump for town supplied by multiple bores, indicate that drought response actions would have \nbeen implemented.  The relevant drought response water level for each system is indicated in \nTable  E11. \nIt is desirable that pre drought ( Mode 2) actions be considered some time before drought action is \nrequired.  An antecedence of 3 months is desirable from a management perspective, however in some \ncases water levels fluctuate widely and there is in sufficient drawdown available to allow for a 3 month l ag \nuntil drought response action is required.  In these cases a lesser antecedence has been adopted to \nensure that pre- drought actions are not considered too frequently.  Drought response actions are \nineffective if they need to be adopted every year.  \nAs noted previously water quality (and bore maintenance) issues can occur if water levels fall below the \ntop of the uppermost screen interval.  It is suspected that this has occurred at the Tullich borefield, \nevidenced by an increase in iron precipitation.  Fo r this reason, the pre drought response trigger is \nconsidered to be the top of screen.  Whilst extraction can continue to occur when water levels fall within \nthe screen interval addition actions may be required:  \n\uf0bb Increased frequency of water quality monitor ing; \n\uf0bb Increased frequency of bore and infrastructure maintenances, e.g. bore development, pipe pigging, sludge removal; and,  \n\uf0bb Consideration of post drought treatments:  \n\u2013 Bore condition assessment;  \n\u2013 Pump replacement / rebuild.  \nTable E11 includes a time lag to provide a response horizon for management.  Modelling has been completed for some of the borefields and the time lag is calculated based on the average rate of \ndrawdown in the worst year modelled.   Where model data was not available, historic  monitoring data has \nbeen used.   The time lag is considered conservative as the modelled and recorded groundwater levels \nfor the borefields in Table E11 typically do not approach the drought response trigger under both current demands , and historic climate.  Where the time lag approaches 6 months or greater , it is likely that the \nreal lag is greater than 1 year as the system will recover in winter before potentially continuing to decline.  \n \n92 \n Figure E11 Groundwater Systems Drought Reponse Triggers  \n \n \nTable E 10 Dr ought Response Action Triggers for Shallow Groundwater Systems  \n Pump depth   \n(depth to top \nof casing)  Mode 3 Trigger      \ndepth to top of \ncasing)  Mode 2 Trigger \n(depth to top \nof casing)  Estimated \nTime Lag1 \nCaramut (No. 1)  43 m  40 m  22.6 m  3 months  \nDarlington (No. 1)  30 m  27 m  17 m  1 month2 \nMortlake  22 m  19 m  17.5 m  < 1 month  \nPenshurst (No 2)  101 m  98 m  95 m  Unknown3 \nTullich (no 2)  34.7 m  31.7 m  22 m  6 months  \nNote 1 \u2013  Time lag between Pre- drought response and drought response triggers in historic design drought (historic climate with \ncurrent demand)  \nNote 2 \u2013  Darlington does nor respond to drought under model conditions, so only based on a historic drawdown over 2 weeks.  \nNote 3 \u2013  Water levels at the Penshurst bores need to be investigated, levels indicated an unexpected potentiometric gradient \nthus drought action triggers solely based on pump depth setting not draw down.  \n \n  \n \n\n \n93 \n Deep Groundwa ter Systems \nThe coastal systems of Port Campbell , Portland, Heywood and Port Fairy are deeply confined and would  \nnot be affected by relatively short term drought conditions .  A similar drought mode response regime to \nthat developed for the shallow systems could be adopted, if water pressures in the deep confined \naquifers were to drop for any reason.    \nThe Dartmoor borefield, whilst behaving as a confined aquifer local to the bore, is located close to an \ninterpreted intake area for the Lower Tertiary Aquifer system, i.e. where the Lower Tertiary Aquifer \nchanges from confined through to unconfined conditions up basin.  The Carlisle River borefield (part of the Otway Supply System) is also interpreted as having connection with surface water flows in the \nGellibrand River.  Under these conditions, both of these borefields are potentially susceptible to drought \nconditions as there may be a shortened lag time between drought and affects at the bore headworks.  \nAn issue with the bores developing the Lower Terti ary Aquifer, and the Macarthur production bore that \ndevelops the Clifton Formation, is that both of these aquifers have an underlying declining water level trend.  Under these conditions, excluding the impact of a drought which may or may not be significan t, \nthe available drawdown in a production bore is being steadily eroded over time.  This decline in available \ndrawdown would be accelerated by changes in demand, which could be seasonal, or through growth.  \nThe establishment of a drought mode response using a trigger based solely on maintaining a minimum head above a production pump may not provide sufficient time for management intervention.  A process that could be considered as been proposed below:  \n\uf0bb The pumping water level response is monitored for each production bore in operation mode 1 \u2013 General M onitoring .  Production bore hydrographs are prepared to identify seasonal response \nthrough the Annual Water Outlook  Tool; \n\uf0bb Monitoring in a pumping bore can provide a \u2018noisy\u2019 response owing to the variable operation of \nproduction pumps.  Therefore, filtering of the water level data is required.  If the seasonal minimum is \ngreater than 10% of the 95% confidence limit, operation mode 2 \u2013 Heightened Awareness is \nimplemented.  More frequent water level monitoring is implemented to characterise the rate of decline (and thus management planning horizon).   \n\uf0bb Drought response (mode 3) is implemented based on the level of drawdown remaining in the bore.   \nThis is shown schematically in Figure E12, and takes into account the potential for available drawdown to be eroded over time.  This should provide management sufficient time to consider the need to replace or \nlower production pumps before available drawdown is reduced to supply threatening levels.  A blanket \napproach adopted a minimum head above a production pump may limit time, particularly for cases where available drawdown can be eroded rapidly, e.g. under extreme conditions, interference effects may occur \nat Portland if sufficient recovery time between pumping events of individual production bores is not \nallowed for.  \nThis is particularly useful as the deep groundwater systems tend to have limited surface storage, i.e. are \nnot suited to long pumping stand- downs, and replacement pumps (owing to high yield and groundwater \ntemperature requirements) can have significant procurement lead times.  It is noted that for most deep \ngroundwater supplies, underlying regional water level declines may be more significant than increased usage affected by drought conditions.   \n \n \n \n94 \n  \nFigure E12 Deep Groundwater Systems Drought Reponse Triggers  \n \n  \n\n \n95 \n References  \nOtway Water Supply System Drought Response  Plan  \nGHD (20 11), Water Supply Demand Strategy 2011- 2060 Water Resources Modelling Baseline Supply -\nDemand Forecasts , Report prepared for Wannon Water,  October . \nGHD (2021), UWS 2022 Modelling Support, Report prepared for Wannon Water, October.  \nSWWA (2000), Drought Response Plan, South West Water Authority.  \nVicWater (2005), Victorian Uniform Drought Water Restriction Guidelines, Final, September.  \nWannon Water (2005), Permanent Water Saving  Plan & Permanent Water Saving  Rules, Wannon \nRegion Water Authority, Draft, September.  \nGrampian s Systems Drought Response  Plan  \nDCNR (1991), Water Victoria \u2013 The Next 100 Years.  \nGHD (2001), Hamilton/Casterton/Coleraine Report on Demand Review.  \nGHD (20 21), UWS 2022 Modelling Support, Report prepared for Wannon Water, October.  \nGlenelg -Wannon Water Board (1992) Drought Response Plan for Balmoral, Casterton, Coleraine, \nSandford and Merino, November 1992.  \nHamilton Water Board (1994) Drought Response Plan, April 1994.  \nKesari N. and McFarlane S.

This Water Restriction By -law sets out four stages of restrictions \nand prohibitions on the use of water that can be mandated by Wannon Water  when it is \nconsidered necessary to conserve wate r.  \nThe restrictions in this By-law apply to water that is supplied by the main water supply works of \nWannon Water , regardless of how that water is delivered.   The restrictions also apply to any \nwater that is a mix of this \u201cmains\u201d water and other water, f or example, if a tank of rain water is \ntopped up with mains water, the restrictions apply to the use of all of the mixed water in the tank.  \nThe restrictions do not apply in relation to recycled or reclaimed water, greywater or stormwater \nwhether or not th at water is supplied by the works of Wannon Water .   \nWater is an essential resource for maintaining life.  The restrictions in this By-law therefore do not \nrestrict the use of water for indoor purposes such as drinking, washing, cleaning or sanitation.  \nAlso, despite any restrictions in this By-law, water can be used at any time:  \n\u2022 for human health requirements;  \n\u2022 for watering of stock and animals;  \n\u2022 for fire fighting;  \n\u2022 for the safety, but not the cleaning, of vehicles and equipment; and  \n\u2022 for cleaning required as a result of an accident, fire, health hazard, safety hazard or other \nemergency  (in accordance with the permitted methods) . \nWhere a restriction relates to a specific use of water, that restriction applies regardless of whether \nthe use is indoors or outdoors .  For example, indoor pools and fountains and undercover nurseries \nare covered by the same restrictions as equivalent outdoor facilities.  However, water cannot be \nused outdoors for any purpose except in accordance with the restrictions in this By-law or with \nthe written permission of Wannon Water .  This means that unless the restrictions in this By-law \nspecify rules about the way in which water can be used outdoors for a particular purpose, then \nwater cannot be used for that purpose.  \nWherever possible, the restrictions in this By-law are designed to be simple, easy to understand \nand straightforward to follow.  For example, outdoor watering is restricted to \"alternate days\", \nwhich means odd numbered properties can be watered on odd numb ered dates and even \nnumbered (or no numbered) properties can be watered on even numbered dates.  Everyone gets \nto water on the 31st of any month and the 29th of February.   \n \n2 \n \n  The restrictions in this  By-law are also designed to build upon  the common sense rules set out in \nthe Permanent Water Saving Plan of Wannon Water , which encourage the efficient use of water \non an ongoing basis.  For example, wherever restrictions in this By-law allow for water to be use d \nfrom a hand -held hose for any purpose, that hose must be leak -free and used with a trigger \nnozzle, consistent with th e permanent water saving rules.  \nContravention of this By-law is an offence under the Water Act 1989 , and so  penalties may apply.   \nExempt ions from the restrictions in this By-law may be granted in certain circumstances.  This By-\nlaw sets out the principles that Wannon Water  will take into account when considering \napplications for exemptions from particular restrictions.   \nThis By-law also p rovides for water to be used in accordance with a Water Use Plan approved by \nWannon Water , despite the restrictions under the prevailing stage of restrictions.  Water Use \nPlans will only be approved where the use of a Plan is expressly permitted for the pa rticular use of \nwater under the relevant stage of restrictions , or where it is required as part of an application for \nan exemption .   \n \n3 \n \n  Wannon Water  makes the following By -law: \n1. AUTHORISING PROVISIONS  \nThis By -law is made under section s 160 , 171(1)(a), (ba), (bb), (e) and (j)  and 287ZC  of the  Act. \n2. PURPOSES  \nThe purposes of this By -law are to:  \n(a) promote the efficient use and conservation of supplied drinking water; and  \n(b) set out four stages of restrictions on the use of supplied drinking  water; and  \n(c) specify things which must not be done while each stage of restriction persists; an d \n(d) specify principles for considering applications for exemptions from particular restrictions; \nand \n(e) prescribe offences and penalties for the contravention of this By -law, including for which an \ninfringement notice may be served; and  \n(f) prescrib e classes of persons for the purpose of issuing infringement notices . \n3. DEFINITIONS  AND INTERPRETATION  \n3.1 Definition s \nThe definitions set out in Part A of Schedule 1, apply in this By -law, unless the contrary intention \nappears.  \n3.2 Interpretation  \nIn this By -law: \n(a) A reference to  a person means an individual, a body or an association (incorporated or \nunincorporated) or a partnership . \n(b) An interpretation  that would promote the efficient use of supplied water must be preferred \nto an interpretation that would not promote that use. \n4. STAGES OF RESTRICTION S \n4.1 Stages of Restrictions  \n(a) Wannon Water  may impose  any of the following stages of restrictions, as the case \nrequires, in any district : \nStage 1 Restrictions  (Alert) ; or \nStage 2 Restrictions  (Save) ; or \nStage 3 Restrictions  (Just Enough) ; or \nStage 4 Restrictions  (Critical ), \n \n4 \n \n  (b) The stage of restr ictions must be imposed , by publishing a notice to that effect  in a \nnewspape r circulating generally in the relevant district  and on the website of Wannon \nWater .  \n4.2 Imposing stages of restriction s \nWannon Water  may impose a stag e of restriction in a district : \n(a)   in accordance with the process  specified in its drought response plan ; or \n(b)   if it reasonably concludes that:  \n(i) because of the failure or limitation of a major pipeline, pumping station, \ntreatment plant or other key water supply work  of Wannon Water  or any other  \nwater corporation , Wannon Water  will temporarily be unable to meet the \ndemands of its customers; or  \n(ii) because of a major water quality issue arising from the failure of a key water \nsupply work referred to in sub-paragrap h (i), or from a bushfire or other \nemergency, Wannon Water  will temporarily be unable to meet the demands of \nits customers ; or \n(iii) the prevailing  stage of restriction has failed to provide the reductions in \ndemand required by Wannon Water  for that stage, in accordance with its \ndrought response plan . \n4.3 Application of restrictions  \nWhen a stage of restriction is imposed in a district under sub -clause 4.2, the relevant restrictions \non water use designated for that stage in Schedule 1 apply in that district.  \n4.4 Declining to impose a stage of restrictions  \nWithout limiting sub-clause 4.2, Wannon Water  may decline to impose a stage of restriction in a \ndistrict if it reasonably concludes that the circumstances indicating the need for that stage a re \nlikely to be so temporary that the public inconvenience caused by imposing that stage of \nrestriction would outweigh the water conservation benefits to be gained from imposing that \nstage.  \n5. GENERAL EXEMPTIONS  \n5.1 Health and Safety Exclusion  \nDespite any provisi on of this By -law, including the restrictions set out in Schedule 1, supplied \ndrinking  water can be used at any time for:  \n(a) human health requirements;  and \n(b) stock and animal health requirements;  and \n(c) fire fighting; and  \n \n5 \n \n  (d) the safety, but not the cleaning, of vehicles or equipment.  \n5.2 General Exemptions  \n(a) Wannon Water  may , in relation to a spe cified district or districts  prepare, adopt and publish \ngeneral exemptions which exempt particular uses or particular users from any restrictions in \nSchedule 1 . \n(b) Wannon Water  may amend or revoke at any time any general exemption adopted under \nparagraph (a).  \n(c) In deciding whether or not to grant a general ex emption  under this sub -clause , Wannon \nWater  must have regard to:  \n(i) the security of available drinking  water supplies in the distr ict; and  \n(ii) recent climate patterns and prevailing seasonal forecasts; and  \n(iii) any anticipated change in demand attributable to the prevailing stage of \nrestriction; and  \n(iv) any other relevant matter that Wannon Water  thinks fit to have regard to.  \n(d) Without limiting pa ragraph 5.2(a), the general exemptions may set out:  \n(i) permissible uses of supplied drinking  water that are exempted from a \nrestriction set out in Schedule 1, without an application being made under \nclause 6; and  \n(ii) the conditions on which an exemption is granted.  \n(e) Exemptions  adopted under paragraph 5.2(a) must be published on Wannon Water 's \nwebsite . \n(f) Notice  of any adoption, amendment or  revocation  of an exemption  must be published in a \nnewspaper circulating generally in the relevant district and on the website of Wannon \nWater . \n(g) An exemption, or an amendment to an exemption under this sub-clause : \n(i) will apply from the date on which a notice of the exem ption is published in a  \nnewspap er circulating generally in the relevant  district ; and \n(ii) will cease to apply in accordance with the terms of the exemption or when \nnotice of the revocation is published in a newspaper circulating generally in the \nrelevant distr ict.  \n(iii) Wannon Water  may prepare and publish general exemptions in co -operation \nwith other water corporations.  \n \n6 \n \n  6. PARTICULAR  EXEMPTIONS  \n6.1 Guidelines regarding Particular Exemptions  \n(a) Wannon Water  may  prepare, adopt and publish  guidelines about applying for exemptions \nunder this clause . \n(b) Wannon Water  may amend or revoke at any time guidelines adopted under paragraph (a).  \n(c) Guidelines adopted under paragraph 6.1(a) must be published on Wannon Water 's website . \n(d) Notice  of the adoption, amendment or  revocation of  guidelines must be published in a \nnewspaper circulating generally in each  district and on the website of Wannon Water .  \n6.2 Applications for Particular Exemptions  \n(a) A person may apply to Wannon Water  for an exemption from a stage of restriction which \nhas been, or w hich may in future be, imposed under clause  4. \n(b) An application for exemption must be in a form approved by Wannon Water . \n (c)      Wannon Water : \n(i) must consider an application for exemption  within a reasonable period ; and  \n(ii) must have regard to any adopted guide lines referred to in sub -clause  6.1; and  \n(iii) subject to this clause:  \n(A) may grant the application  in full or in part and subject to such conditions \nas Wannon Water  considers  appropriate; or  \n(B) may refuse the application.  \n(d)     Wannon Water  may revoke any exemption at any time, by giving written notice to the \napplicant.  \n(e)      An exemption ends at any time specified in the exemption, or when:  \n(i) the stage of restriction to which the exemption relates is lifted; or  \n(ii) a more severe stage of restriction is impose d.   \n6.3 Approval of Particular Exemptions  \nSubject to this clause, Wannon Water  must not grant an application for exemption in relation to a \nparticular stage of restriction, unless Wannon Water  is reasonably satisf ied that: \n(a) the proposed exemption:  \n \n7 \n \n  (i) is neces sary to avoid an inequitable and disproportionately adverse impact \nupon the livelihood of the applicant which would be caused by the level of \nrestriction; or \n(ii) would result in less supplied drinking  water  being used by the applicant t han \nthe lesser amount of  supplied drinking  water that the applicant would \notherwise  have been allowed by Wannon Water  to use; or  \n(iii) based on prior consumption, is likely to have used for the same purpose under \nthat stage of restriction; or \n(iv) is necessary because of the special needs of the applicant ; or  \n(v) would avoid or minimise appreciable physical damage to a building or other \nstructure owned or occupied by the applicant during that stage of restriction; \nor \n(vi) is necessary to avoid any adverse effect on public health or safety ; and \n(b) the proposed exemption would not, in combination with the use of supplied drinking \nwater  in accordance with other exemptions granted or reasonably anticipated by Wannon \nWater  to be granted for similar uses of supplied drinking water , have a significa nt impact \non: \n(i) the total daily demand for supplied drinking  water  by Wannon Water 's \ncustomers ; or  \n(ii) the security of available drinking  water  supplies in the district where the use \nwill occur ; and \n(c) the proposed exemption would, in the opinion of Wannon Wat er, be generally supported \nby other Wannon Water  customers who are affected by that stage of restriction.  \n6.4 Particular  Exemptions for Public Garden Areas  \nDespite sub -clause 6.3, Wannon Water  may grant an application for exemption to use supplied \ndrinking  water to water  a public garden area during a period of  stage 4 restrictions if: \n(a) the application is accompanied by an approved Water Use Plan  for the public garden  area ; \nand \n(b) Wannon Water  is rea sonably sati sfied that, if the garden is watered  in accordance with the \nWater Use Plan, the exemption  would not, in combination with the use of supplied drinking  \nwater in accordance with  other exemptions granted, or reasonably anticipated by Wannon \nWater  to be granted, under t his clause , have a significant impact on: \n(i) the total daily demand for supplied drinking  water  by Wannon Water 's \ncustomers ; or  \n(ii) the security of available drinking  water  supplies in the district whe re the use \nwill occur . \n \n8 \n \n  6.5 Particular Exemptions for Certain Playing Surfaces  \n(a) Despite sub -clause 6.3, Wannon Water  may  grant an application for exemption to use \nsupplied drinking  water to water  any playing surface during a period of any stage of \nrestriction i f:  \n(i) the application is accompanied by an approved Water Use Plan;

This Permanent \nWater Saving Plan reflects the value that the community places on water and sets out a set of common \nsense rules to encourage the efficient use of water and avoid wasting this precious resource.   \nThe rules in this Plan are designed to support the commitment that Victorian communities have made to \nusing water more efficiently.  Many households and businesses are harvesting their own water through \nrainwater tanks, have installed water-efficient appliances, are adopting water-wise practices and are \nchoosing to turn off their taps whenever possible.  The rules in this Plan support this collective \ncommitment by requiring the community to use common sense and best practices as part of their \neveryday use of water.    \nWannon Water will continue to work with its community to support individual efforts to use water more \nefficiently.  This will help to ensure there is enough water to sustain liveable and prosperous communities \ninto the future.   \nThe rules in this Plan are also supported by the provisions of the Water Act 1989 which require that water \nmust not be wasted.  Allowing water to run off into a gutter, ditch, or drain or failing to repair a \ncontrollable leak from equipment or infrastructure is considered by Wannon Water  to be wastage o f \nwater .  \nWater is an essential resource for maintaining life.  This Plan therefore does not restrict the use of water \nfor domestic, indoor purposes such as drinking, washing, cleaning or sanitation.  Also, despite any rules in \nthis Plan, water can be used at any time: \n for human health requirements;  \n for watering of stock and animals; \n for fire fighting;  \n for the safety, but not the cleaning, of vehicles and equipment; or \n for cleaning required as a result of an accident, fire, health hazard, safety hazard or other \nemergency (in accordance with the permitted methods). \n1.

Wannon Water requires that all employees maintain a standard of dress that supports its professional image, while maintaining a safe working environment.\n\nThis procedure describes how the Wannon Water\u2019s logoed clothing is issued, modified and subsidised.\nScope\nThis procedure applies to all Administrative/Technical/Professional employees (other than those who are required to wear PPE) of Wannon Water.\nDress Code Statement. \nWhen at work for Wannon Water, any administrative/technical/professional employees should choose clothing that represents Wannon Water to the community and upholds our image.  The clothing you wear to work should feel comfortable and you should select clothes that enable productivity and individualism.\n\nThe standard of dress that most people deem to be respectful to clients and colleagues. As an inclusive workplace, we need to be mindful of other people\u2019s sensibilities and cultures. \n\nIt is important to dress for your day. Consider who you will be meeting and ensure your clothing is professional, safe and appropriate for your working tasks and environment.\n\nEmployees may choose to purchase Wannon Water logoed clothing in line with this procedure. This logoed clothing can be worn together or mix and match items of the with your own clothing in accordance with this dress code statement.\n\nIf employees choose not to wear Wannon Water logoed clothing, they are encouraged to wear their name badge, especially at externally facing events. \nProcedure \nWannon Water Logoed Clothing\n\nThe cost of the Wannon Water logoed clothing is to be covered by the employee but the first $250.00 per financial year is subsidised by Wannon Water and the remaining amount is tax deductible.  \n\nWannon Water will reimburse full-time employees $250.00 Incl GST, per financial year who elect to purchase Wannon Water logoed clothing from their choice of supplier. Part-time employees are entitled to $250.00 Incl GST, per financial year on a pro rata basis, based on the number of hours worked as a percentage of 38 hours per week. Reimbursement will be eligible to employees once they have completed their probation period.\n\n\nThe wearing of Wannon Water logoed clothing is entirely the choice of each individual.  Purchased Wannon Water logoed clothing can be mixed with personal attire or previously issued Wannon Water logoed clothing.\n\nAll clothing that has been embroidered with the Wannon Water logo is deemed to be the property of Wannon Water and therefore must be returned on the last day of employment or as directed by Wannon Water.  \n\nAlternatively, individual garments that have been purchased by the employee at their own expense and then monogrammed may be retained by the employee for their personal use so long as proof that the logo has been removed from the clothing is provided.\n\n\n\nAll items must be embroidered with the Wannon Water logo prior to the $250.00 subsidy being reimbursed by Wannon Water to the employee.\n\nLogoed clothing may also be purchased from online catalogues which are provided by the Administrative Support Officer Corporate Services. Items purchased from the catalogue must not exceed any more than the $250 Incl GST, allowance. Wannon Water will be invoiced directly from the supplier.\n\nRebate Claim\nA rebate subsidy of up to $250.00 Incl GST, per financial year will be reimbursed to employees who lodge the receipts received from the retailers for purchase of Wannon Water uniform style clothing and had the items embroidered with Wannon Water\u2019s logo.  Employees may make two claims throughout one financial year with the rebate being paid on a pro-rata basis provided the $250.00 Incl GST, is not exceeded.\n\nThe Administrative Support Officer Corporate Services will raise purchase orders for the embroidery of garments and organise for ensuring the garments are embroidered. \n\nEmployees should complete the eForm \u2018Internal Tax Invoice\u2019, attach receipts for purchase of  clothing items and forward to their relevant Manager. Once approved it will then be forwarded and processed by the Administrative Support Officer Corporate Services. No rebate will be issued until the embroidery has been completed on the garments and received the invoice for embroidery of the items.\n\nThe cost of embroidering will be met by Wannon Water and will not form part of the $250.00 Incl GST, subsidy.\n\nThe removal of the previous corporate style guidelines and corporate uniform requirements results in Wannon Water no longer meeting the requirements of the Australian Taxation Office\u2019s compulsory or non-compulsory work uniform due to the flexibility in clothing style it allows.   Employees will therefore no longer being able to claim a tax deduction for corporate uniform purchases and laundry expenses, even for Wannon Water logoed clothing.\nAlterations and Care of Wannon Water logoed clothing\nAny alterations required to the Wannon Water logoed clothing once received are to be arranged and paid for by the employee.\n\nWannon Water will not meet the cost of laundering or dry cleaning of any Wannon Water logoed clothing.  Please refer to the care instructions on each garment.  Should an item be rendered unwearable due to lack of attention to care instructions, the item must be replaced at the wearer\u2019s expense.  Any ongoing maintenance such as repairs to zips, seams, hems, buttons, etc. should be made as soon as necessary at the wearer\u2019s expense.  \n\nAdministrative/Technical/Professional Employees Working Outdoors\nShould an administrative/technical/professional employee be required to work outdoors, or visit an outdoor worksite, they are required to comply with Wannon Water\u2019s Occupational Health & Safety Policy by wearing high visibility, long sleeves, long pants, closed in shoes and a broad brim hat.\n\nOperations, Maintenance and Support Coordinators\nAs Coordinators are not always out on-site and may prefer to wear their own clothing, Wannon Water logoed clothing or fluorescent PPE or a combination of these. \n\nExternal Operations/Maintenance Services Employees\nAll employees with field based duties are supplied with Wannon Water outdoor uniform/protective clothing as detailed in the PPE Uniform and Footwear Catalogue and Personal Protective Equipment and Field Uniform Policy.\n\nTemporary or Casual Employees\nTemporary or casual employees are deemed to be employees who are not permanent employees with Wannon Water.  Office based temporary or casual employees may purchase Wannon Water logoed clothing items at their own expense, or otherwise comply with the dress code.
